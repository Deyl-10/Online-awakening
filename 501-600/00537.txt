Hahaha…

Qin Luo Sheng could not help but laugh wildly.

This was simply too awesome!

According to the strengthening plan—

Enhanced Black Body equipment was a grade of 10 basic attributes, 20 basic attributes of Bronze, 30 basic attributes of Silver, 40 basic attributes of Gold, 80 basic attributes of Epic, 160 basic attributes * grade, and 320 basic attributes * grade of Mythical!

[Coiling Dragon Water] was Legendary, which was 160 Basic Attack * 5 = 800 points!

Enhance Level 1 and increase 800 basic attacks!

Enhancement + 10, which meant an increase of 8,000 basic attacks!

And—

From Enhancement + 7, there would be additional Enhancement rewards.

[Coiling Dragon Water] 's enhancement + 10 reward was very scary.

+ 100% Physical Attack. Even though it was only effective against [Coiling Dragon Li Water], according to the current Physical Attack of [Coiling Dragon Li Water], it had 10,800, doubling it to 21,600!

Pervert!

Apart from that—

The other effect was the ultimate reward.

What did it mean to be supreme?

In short, it was perfect.

+ 10 was the limit of equipment improvement. It was not overboard to call it perfect.

It was not surprising to have such an additional reward.

When attacking, there was a 50% chance to double the damage!

This was a bit of a bug!

This was especially so for a player like Qin Sheng who already had explosive attack power. He was definitely like a tiger that had grown wings.

Because.

This effect did not clearly state that it was only effective against [Coiling Dragon Water].

If it worked as a whole, once Qin Luo Sheng unleashed all his firepower, the damage, tsk tsk, even killing Legendary Bosses would cost hundreds of thousands or millions. On the basis of this, if he triggered another doubling—

Just thinking about it was enough to make one tremble with excitement!

"I'm not f*cking supporting you in vain. Enhancement + 10, yds!"

Qin Luo Sheng was so excited that he could hardly contain himself.

Under the tremendous pressure, this strengthening process was as crazy as a madman. Finally, the ending that he wanted the most had arrived.

Too fierce!

The [Coiling Dragon Water] that was enhanced by + 10 was too powerful!

Basic Physical Attack went from 2800 to 21600!

Additionally, there was a 50% chance of doubling the damage.

Who could withstand this?

"Continue! Continue!"

With a living example before him, how could Qin Sheng endure it?

Even though not every piece of equipment on him was worth strengthening + 10, he did not have that many resources (High-Level Augmenting Gems were not enough). However, with all of them + 7, obtaining the lowest additional effect should not be a problem.

"Come on, let's start!"

The success of the [Coiling Dragon Water] gave Qin Sheng immense confidence!

The strength of the [Coiling Dragon Water] also magnified the greed in Qin Sheng's heart!

If he did not reorganize his equipment, he would feel uncomfortable!

Unfortunately…

The strengthening system could only strengthen the outer five items, at least for now. If the inner five items and Numinous Treasures could also be strengthened, how good would that be?

Tsk tsk…

This was what it meant to be a snake trying to swallow an elephant.

He was still f*cking rejoicing a moment ago, but now, he had turned hostile?

Ha ~

Men!

Enhancement + 7 was extremely simple for Qin Sheng.

Advanced Artificing had been enhanced by an enhancement of + 10, but the enhancement was purely based on experience and techniques, high luck, as well as the foundation of spirit crystals!

Qin Luo Sheng had only lost a little, but he had already finished strengthening the remaining four—no, five—of the five items!

As for + 8?

‘ Excuse me.’

Not worthy!

After all.

The risk of + 8 was quite high. Other than the [Skeleton Armor] and [Obsidian Crown] which were Gold rank, the rest were Epic-ranked. However, they were Epic-ranked, unlike [Coiling Dragon Water], which had no level restriction and could evolve.

In a situation where they were destined to be eliminated, too much investment was not worth it.

If not for the fact that there were no substitutes available, Qin Luo Sheng would not even want to strengthen his [Skeleton Armor] and [Obsidian Crown] to the level of + 7.

After some thought.

He was a Weeping Soul Beast, so he could not lose face. He had a full set + 7, but he did not have any armor. What was that?

In addition, + 7 [Skeleton Armor] and [Obsidian Crown] were rare items. If they were not needed in the future, he would sell them. It should not be a loss. Hence, he pinched his nose and bought them together.

"This consumption is really terrifying!"

After some maneuvering.

Full set + 7!

Qin Luo Sheng put on his equipment one by one. Instantly, his body was surrounded by orange light (the original radiance of the equipment was sparkling, while the enhancement was revolving). Coupled with the radiance of the equipment itself, it was truly dazzling.

"It's a pity that I'm not at level 40 yet. Otherwise, wouldn't it be great if I could strengthen the Duality Dao Sword and the Glazed Daoist Robe that I had prepared beforehand?"

Qin Luo Sheng sighed. "It's just that the consumption of high-grade Augmenting Gems is quite fast!"

Initial-level Augmenting Gems could drop all Bosses. Even normal monsters had a chance of dropping them!

Mid-level Augmenting Gems were only dropped by Silver Bosses!

Only Gold Bosses would drop Advanced Augmenting Gems!

Although Qin Luo had killed many bosses above Gold and above, the drop rate was not guaranteed. High-level Augmenting Gems had a very low drop rate, and he did not have much stock.

This time, he had used up a total of twelve pieces. He only had a single digit left, so he had to use it sparingly.

After all.

+ 7 needed to use this thing from the beginning. It consumed a lot of energy.

“The strengthening of equipment has come to an end for the time being. The preparations are complete. Now, it is time to set off for the Dark Abyss to complete my Second Stage Professional Mission!”

After resting for a while and recovering some strength, Qin Sheng activated his skill. "Spatial Jump!"

His vision spun.

In a flash, Qin Sheng was transported from the sealed forging room to the lush Moonlight Forest countless kilometers away.

"Little cuties, I'm back again!"

Looking at the dense pack of Gale Wolves before him, a terrifying smile appeared on Qin Sheng's lips.

"Summon Xiaoxiao!"

"Summon Ice!"

A pet and a mount were summoned by Qin Sheng.

"Xiaoxiao, sweep!"

Qin Luo Sheng activated his skill "Dragon Might". In an instant, 20% of the life force was forcibly taken out of the hundreds of wolves.

"Howl…"

"Howl…"

"Howl…"

——————

Author's Note: The grade of strengthening equipment is determined by the level range. It is similar to a player's Class Advancement level. For example, Level 35 equipment. This level is already Second Stage Professional and is not enough for Third Stage and 50 levels. Therefore, Level 35 equipment is classified as Grade 2! And those without Grade are calculated according to the highest level 100 Fifth Stage. Coiling Dragon Li Water does not have a level requirement, which means it has no grade. Hence, it is considered Grade 5!
