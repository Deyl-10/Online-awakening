Qin Luo Sheng: o ((⊙ ▽ ⊙) o

Oh my god!

Was this a legendary pet?

I got it!

Level 0 already had 3,000 Health Points, 10,000 Mana Points, 100 Physical Attack, 800 Magic Attack, Physical Defense, and Magic Defense. Two passive skills, two active skills. Was he trying to go to heaven?

When Qin Luo Sheng compared himself to him when he was at level 0, he was instantly silent and dazed.

Damn it.

Wasn't the difference too great?

There was simply no comparison!

Come and see—

There was no need to talk about the basic attributes. It was almost the same as the Boss. The man looked at Silent Disaster while the woman cried.

The main thing was skills.

The body of a true dragon could be overlooked. As a member of the dragon race, he was already blessed by the heavens. This was a talent that could not be envied.

Elemental Affinity. Thinking about how his initial magic value was as high as 10,000, this guy was definitely a magic type.

This passive ability was incredible. Its power and range had increased by half. It might not be obvious in the early stages, but when it matured in the later stages, the effect it could bring was unimaginable.

Elemental magic was similar to fireballs, icicles, earth spikes, wind blades, and other low-level spells!

The final ultimate skill, Dragon Roar Shock, had a strength of 500%, three seconds of fear, and was violent and elegant. Compared to himself, it was almost the same as an Epic skill like Berserk Strike.

"We've struck gold!"

Qin Luo Sheng looked at the little guy who was curled up in the pet space sleeping. Waves of happiness surged through him, almost knocking him unconscious.

"Right now, I'm invincible in close combat. If I nurture this little guy, with long-range support, my only weakness will be made up. I won't be in a situation where I can't fight back when I encounter kite-type Bosses."

Qin Luo was pleasantly surprised. "It's a legend to begin with. Your growth rate is simply unimaginable. As expected of the treasure left behind by the Dragon God, something that the dragon race has guarded for countless years. Looks like in the following period of time, other than working hard to raise your level, it's time to properly nurture you."

He opened the pet rankings—

First place:??? Race: Dragon Race, Grade: Legendary, Owner: Weeping Soul!

Second place: Spirit Flower Immortal, Race: None, Grade: Nine, Owner: Azure Silk!

Third place: Exploding Tiger King, Race: Tiger Clan, Grade: Six, Owner: Martial Emperor!

Fourth place: Stone Golem Puppet. Race: None. Grade: Six. Owner: East Imperial!

Fifth place: Hurricane Panther, Race: Panther Race, Grade: Sixth Level, Owner: Yatu!

Sixth place: Killer Bee Emperor, Race: Bee Race, Grade: Level Five, Owner: Young Master Thunderbolt!

Seventh place: None

# 8: For now

Ninth place: None temporarily

# 10: None for now

(Author’s Note: Only fifth-level pets have the qualifications to be on the list. Ninth-level pets are the highest. After ninth-level pets are Epic pets)

Was it that powerful?

Qin Qin Sheng was somewhat surprised.

The Pet System had only been open for a day, yet these people on the rankings had already gotten powerful pets?

What surprised Qin Sheng the most was Qing Si. She was ranked second on the ranking list and was only one step away from the Epic stage. How did she do it in just one day?

"Experts are indeed not to be underestimated!"

With a sigh in his heart, Qin Sheng opened the pet column again and looked at the three question marks on it. He thought for a moment, then tapped his finger lightly and said, "Xiaoxiao!"

Ding… naming success!

As the system notification sounded, the number one pet on the pet rankings, the legendary super pet, the proud true dragon, was given a terrible name by Qin Sheng, the unscrupulous master who had difficulty naming.

"Young Master, we have arrived! This is the best medicine pavilion in Dragon City!”

The Damask Damask's gentle and pure voice interrupted Qin Sheng's thoughts. He raised his head and followed the Damask Damask's jade-like fingers to look. He saw a five-story building that occupied an area that was measured in acres. A huge building that was at least eight to nine meters tall lay before his eyes. There was a golden plaque that read, 'Medicine Pavilion!'

“Oh? Little brother, you seem quite unfamiliar. Why are you here at my Spiritual Medicine Pavilion?”

Stepping through the door, a shrewd middle-aged man dressed as a shopkeeper immediately came to welcome the guests. His smiling expression immediately gave people a favorable impression.

Ding… Because your charm is maxed out, the owner of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, Gu Feng, has a favorable impression of you + 500. Relationship has been raised to heart! '

“Greetings, shopkeeper. I have just arrived at Dragon Island and have just arrived. I heard that your Spiritual Medicine Pavilion is the best medicinal pavilion on Dragon Island, so I have specially come to broaden my horizons.”

Qin Luo smiled.

Once the charm value was used, the effect would be devastating. The moment they met, they would put their trust in each other. Such a miraculous effect was extremely brutal no matter which aspect was used. Especially when it came to making friends or doing business, it was like adding wings to a tiger.

"Thank you for your kindness, honored guest."

Everyone loved flattery, especially when it came to weak points and flattery.

Even though he knew that Qin Sheng was just complimenting him, Gu Feng was still rather happy that it involved the inheritance and family business of his ancestors, as well as his lifetime of effort and pride. He pulled Qin Sheng towards the inner room.

"Our Spiritual Medicine Pavilion has a membership system. This is a rule set by our ancestors. Even if I'm the boss and shopkeeper, I can't change it."

As Gu Feng spoke, he handed over a golden card. “However, I still have some authority. Come, brother, take this membership card first. If you need anything, just let me know. I guarantee that I’ll get it done properly for you.”

Oh.

Gold membership card?

It seemed like he had underestimated the effect of his charm. Didn't this directly bring him fortune?
