Chapter 645: The World Shaking! Big Incident

It was a sunny day!

Apparently.

Just like yesterday.

Just like the day before.

There was no difference.

Yet.

The spread of this news shook the entire world. Countless players, be it Chinese or other war zones, all looked towards the eastern lands and the Chinese war zone.

'Executing justice on behalf of the heavens, surrounding and killing the world's greatest cancer: Weeping Soul.'

As soon as this post was published, it was immediately pushed to the peak of the forum. Its popularity soared and even the official posts were pushed down.

There were countless replies under the post.

"The sofa!"

"Mine on the first floor. Eat shit on the second floor."

"The third floor. The benches have been moved. Take the melon seeds and peanuts. Wait for the performance on the second floor."

"Really? The title is Sima!"

“A

 Yeah. 

G me? "

"Idiot! Another lousy post that swindles people to recover their popularity. Reported!"

"Looking for trouble with the Weeping Soul Beast? OP, are you still sleeping?"

"Interesting. Weeping Soul Beast just appeared on the World TV. He killed a Legendary Boss single-handedly. There are actually people who are not afraid of death and want to find trouble with such big shots?"

"Liar, appraisal complete!"

"…"

Initial.

No one believed him.

After all.

This was too unbelievable.

Not to mention that Weeping Souls was very powerful and could appear and disappear unpredictably, they did not appear in public at all and hid themselves very well. Moreover, Weeping Souls was constantly appearing on the world television, bringing great glory to the Huaxia Battle Zone, as well as true glory (experience increase, drop-rate increase), Huize the entire Huaxia Battle Zone, and all the Chinese players.

He was a hero!

A hero of China!

There was no doubt about it.

China had always valued heroes. Even if there were good and bad people, and there were many people who did not accept the Weeping Soul Beast, at least on the surface, no one would dare to act rashly.

So.

This was undoubtedly a rotten piece of iron that attracted attention and deceived people to reply.

Hence.

There was a wave of scolding below the post. Other than the Chinese players, the players from the other warzones were the same. Most of them expressed their contempt and anger towards this kind of behavior. There were also quite a number of sobbing fans who cursed the OP's entire family of women because their idol was insulted. They were very irritable.

‘ But—’

When screenshots of high-definition photos were posted by the original poster, the entire post fell silent.

That's right.

The person on the screenshot was indeed sobbing.

Even though Weeping Soul Beast rarely showed its face, everyone in the world knew that Weeping Soul Beast had the habit of uploading videos.

From the video, everyone recognized Weeping Soul's costume.

The rest could be faked.

However, the costume of the Weeping Soul Beast was unique and could not be faked.

For example, the only Mythical divine weapon in the Fated World, [Coiling Dragon Li Water], a belt with flowing light, a mask with evil spirit patterns, and a silver cloak…

It was confirmed!

Weeping Soul, he was really being ganged up on!

In the picture, there were countless people on the plankway…

All of them showed that Weeping Soul had been forced into a desperate situation!

Instantly.

The forum exploded.

The crappy post immediately became a godly post, its popularity crazily rising, continuously rising.

Soon.

The administrator noticed. After confirming the authenticity of the post, he did not hesitate to push it to the top.

Thus…

More people saw it.

Because of this, more people were attracted.

The whole world—

It completely erupted, starting a great earthquake!

…

America!

White House!

"Unbelievable. Are the Chinese crazy?"

The blond American president was completely stunned when he heard the news from the Secretary of State.

The image of China was deeply rooted in the world.

It was hard to imagine.

There would be a day in China where someone would dare to treat a meritorious official so openly. They wanted to overturn the structure of the world of fate, and even influence it to the real world. The current number one person in the world of fate was weeping!

This was impossible in any country in the world, especially the United States, which advocated individual heroism.

You have to know.

An expert like Weeping Soul, a hero like that, that was enough to lead an era, a country, a nation, to the true peak and glory!

China—

How dare she?

Weren't they afraid of losing Weeping Souls like those elites who were constantly heading out, especially towards the Merika Nation?

"Hahaha… God is really helping me!"

The President of the United States of America laughed out loud. With a serious expression, he said to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the FBI's Chief Inspector, "This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. You don't need me to teach you what to do, right? Sirs, once this matter is done, we can even rewrite the world's structure and the fate of the United States of America. Contact Weiyun at all costs and give him all the preferential treatment he can give. We must bring him back to the United States of America and make him a great American."

"As you wish, Mr. President!"

A group of men in black suits bowed and answered with smiles.

…

Japan.

Heavenly Emperor Palace.

“That foolish person, his pathetic inferiority, never learned his lesson, actually still causing internal strife.”

When the aged Emperor received the news from Heavenlight's Great Divine Palace, he couldn't help but sneer. "Heroes are always lonely, and there will never be a good ending. It's a pity that a genius like Weeping Soul is being treated like this. Fortunately, the world of fate is just a virtual world, Weeping Soul will not really die. If such a talent joins my Japan, in time, we will definitely be able to suppress China, get rid of America, and stand at the top of the world."

Below.

The Grand Divine Officials of the Great Divine Palace of Amaterasu, the Japanese Prime Minister, and others stood with their hands by their sides.

"Activate the Chinese spies and find Weeping Soul information at all costs. We must turn him against us and bring him back to Japan."

Soon.

The emperor gave the order.

"Hi!"

The clerics and officials of the Prime Minister's Palace listened respectfully.

"That's right. Start a public war. We must make Weeping Soul Beast give up on China completely."

The emperor continued, "If necessary, we can cooperate with them. However, Weeping Soul must belong to the Japanese."

…

China.

Zhongnanhai.

"Bang…"

The sound of the teacup shattering silenced the entire conference room.

The eight elders looked at the First Elder, who had never been so angry before, in shock and speechlessness.

Except.

They also understood the Great Elder's anger.

Because.

They were also furious.

"What do you think of this matter?"

The Great Elder had a high level of self-restraint. He quickly restrained his emotions and quietened down. He returned to his seat and looked at the eight pillars of China. He asked, "The imperialism will not give up on us. They will definitely make a big fuss about this matter. They will arrange many spies in our country to mislead the people of our country. They will misunderstand us and make Weeping Souls misunderstand us. If we don't handle this well, it might even affect the fate of our country."

The eight elders shuddered.

It shook the fate of the country.

This was an unprecedented crisis!

Wasn't this a little too serious?

But on second thought.

Everyone fell silent again.

If a large number of citizens were really misled and lost confidence in their country, especially Weeping Soul Beast himself, once he was disloyal to China, or even transferred to another country, with the influence of Fate Dimension today, especially in the future, it would definitely be even more influential. The fate of the country would really be shaken.

"Comrades, this is going to be a tough battle!"

The Great Elder took a deep breath and said with a heavy tone, “In the past, there have been countless precedents like this. Everyone has experience in dealing with it. However, what I want to say is that this time, the situation is different. Other than the fact that the situation is more urgent and more dangerous, it is very likely that imperialism will unite one after another. We need to be extremely focused. This is a war, everyone must be prepared!”

Eight Elders: "Yes!"
