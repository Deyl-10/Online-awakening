Chapter 124: World Live Broadcast

A terrible breakfast was served!

Finally!

Qin Luo had compromised!

After cleaning up the table, Qin Luo came to the living room. Looking at the closed door, he recalled the two sets of new clothes he bought when he carried him out to buy breakfast. He sneered when he heard that it was Nan Nan who was trying on the clothes.

Hur!

Women!

Stop pretending, I've already seen through you!

Other women's eyes would light up when they saw the new cosmetics and clothes. As for you, although there was a hint of surprise in your eyes, your expression remained calm.

Try on clothes?

I think you went to sleep again?

"What a headache!"

Qin Luo was slumped on the sofa, clutching his forehead helplessly. "Didn't the doctor say that Nan Nan was frightened by the car accident and might be a little autistic? I don't see autism, but what's the principle behind this sleepiness?"

"Let's observe him for a few more days. If it's just a coincidence, then we'll move on. If this continues, we have to go to the hospital to take a look. If he really is sick, we can treat him earlier."

Having made up his mind, Qin Sheng also temporarily put this matter aside!

Looking at the time, it was almost midnight!

"Is it coming?"

Qin Sheng's expression froze. He picked up his tablet, opened Fate Corporation's official website, and locked onto the news conference channel.

"Are you going to execute me publicly so that I can witness the darkness of the world, or is it that evil can never triumph over good? Are you going to clear my name and let everything go smoothly?"

Qin Qin Sheng locked onto the screen of the tablet and waited for the mainframe's test to start at 12 o'clock sharp. "The final moment is coming. Who won the game behind the scenes?"

12 o'clock sharp!

The black screen flashed and an image appeared!

In a huge auditorium, it was filled to the brim with empty seats. They came from various countries and ethnicities. They had different skin colors and looked solemn!

Who were they?

The people in the front row were the people sent by the various countries to manage Fate Corporation. Behind them were familiar faces because they were programmers who created the virtual world called Fate Dimension!

“Hello, Eve

You bastard! "

At this moment, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed host appeared. After a simple greeting, she immediately went to the main topic.

Qin Sheng listened to his opening remarks until he was drowsy, because his main content was about the cause and effect of this major incident. Who in the world did not know about this trivial matter?

Luckily, it did not last long before the host left the stage!

After the host left, a middle-aged American from the press conference came up. His name was Ao Lai, and he was the leader of the five chief executives of Fate Corporation.

This B was also the style of Western politicians. All kinds of nonsense, all kinds of statements, all kinds of flaunting of justice and fairness, and so on!

More than an hour had passed!

Finally!

The main topic was here!

Aulai first showed the official document signed by the United Nations, indicating that the test was approved by the United Nations and was legal!

Then—

Connect to the mainframe!

"I have a few questions in my hands now. I have chosen the areas that the players from all over the world are most concerned about. After screening them, I have obtained the approval of the United Nations Elders to ask the mainframe."

Ao Lai raised the document in his hand and spoke to the camera with a serious expression. Through the live broadcast, everything was public and transparent to the world.

Soon!

The mainframe had contacted him!

The hundred-inch screen flickered!

At the next moment!

An extremely magnificent palace appeared. It was like the celestial palace in Chinese mythology. It floated above the clouds. There were pavilions, pavilions, small bridges, flowing streams, and flowers. Spirit beasts flew, and rainbow lights filled the sky…

Everyone was stunned by this beautiful scene. So was Qin Sheng!

However, before everyone could take a closer look, like a movie scene, the camera zoomed in and went all the way from looking down at the celestial palace. They passed through many palace gates and arrived at a huge garden deep in the celestial palace.

"What questions do you have?"

An ethereal and cold voice that was filled with authority sounded out. Everyone's attention couldn't help but be attracted over.

They saw!

In the middle of the garden that was filled with spiritual plants, there was a small pavilion. The water was flowing and the pavilion was shrouded in mist. It was overflowing with immortal aura and was full of vitality.

In the pavilion!

A graceful figure was sitting in the middle. At this moment, she was facing them. However, because of the mist, her body was hazy, making it impossible to see her figure and face clearly. They could only vaguely see her unbelievably slim curves, her general outline, and her pair of eyes that were filled with godhood.

"Is she the mainframe?"

At this moment, it was not only Qin Sheng who had this question in his head. Almost 100% of the people in the world had the same question.

"Hello, Mastermind. I'm Aulai. On behalf of the Elders of the United Nations, I have some questions for you!"

After all, Aulay was a politician, and he quickly broke away from His extreme charm. He lowered his head and did not dare to look into His eyes again, or perhaps it was just a simple bow. At the same time, he explained.

"I already know!"

"He" was unmoved and remained seated like an immovable mountain. "Ask away. There are only three questions!"

"Alright, thank you for your cooperation!"

There were only three questions and it was not enough. However, Aulai did not feel troubled at all. He must have discussed it beforehand. He looked at the document in his hand and asked, "The first question is, is there a cheat or a bug in the Fate Dimension?"

This originally meaningless question had become the first of the three limited questions. This was also the most important question in the world!

"No!"

Under the bated breath of billions of people, 'He' replied. 'A neat word. No redundancy. No correction.'

Qin Luo heaved a sigh of relief.

But the world was in an uproar!

‘ No?’

Did he really not cheat?

Was there really no bug?

Really?

It seemed to be true!

Then why were they angry all this time? What was the point of their hard work?

Waste of time + Waste of expression—?

"Second question, are there any abnormalities with the Chinese player ID 'Weeping Soul'?"

Ole did not care what others thought. He faithfully fulfilled his duty and asked the second question without stopping.

"No!"

His answer was still the same two words.

All the players around the world:…

Qin Qin Sheng: O (qi _ qi) O ~

Mastermind, I want you!

"Alright, then the third question!" Aulai's expression froze, and the corner of his mouth twitched as he asked the third question. "Can you reveal the true information of 'Weeping Soul', the game attributes, awakened talent, current equipment, and learned skills?"

Was it a big move?

Was he finally going to expose that damn “Weeping Soul”?

The entire world waited with bated breath!

“c

Damn it, GDx is so shameless. What kind of bullshit question is that? "

Compared to the others, Qin Sheng flew into a rage. He had initially thought that he had managed to escape this calamity. He had not expected himself to be naive.

Damn that country bumpkin!

He was actually so vicious. He actually used such a drastic measure to kill him!
