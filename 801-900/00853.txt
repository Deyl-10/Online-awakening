Chapter 853: The Chosen One, The Birth Of The Carp (1)

"Hello, my dear friends. I'm sorry to inform everyone that we have already carried out the idle routine of the 139th episode. From today onwards, it will be temporarily halted!"

Wolf Fang live streaming platform.

It was originally one of the top live streaming platforms in China.

Unfortunately.

After the appearance of Fate Dimension, all of these were destroyed!

Wolf was not the only one. The entire gaming industry and the live streaming industry had been devastated by the prehistoric Tyrannosaurus Rex.

There was no other way.

Fate Dimension's impact was too strong!

The gaming industry that the livestreaming platform relied on for survival had been completely wrecked. So what if the livestream platform had taken drastic measures? Relying on outdoors, relying on looks… What could these boards do? They could not hold up!

Fortunately.

The Fate Corporation did not go all out and gave the broadcast rights to Fate Dimension.

‘ Of course.’

The capitalists would not be so kind.

With Fate Corporation's capabilities, how easy would it be to create a live-stream platform?

With the trump card of Fate Dimension, even if it was a new live-streaming platform, it was extremely easy to gain popularity.

The reason for the authorization was because he had bought over half of the shares of all the major platforms in the world. With absolute control over the shares, it was no longer a big deal even if it was his own subsidiary!

It was because of this that the Wolf Fang live-streaming platform was not destroyed in the storm. It was still operating even now!

Still.

Even so, he still received an absolute shock!

Fate Corporation did not have a live-stream platform, but on the official website, Qin Sheng still had a live-stream panel. That was where he did his live-stream!

"Little Meng Live Broadcast: The Daily Life of a Salted Fish in the Fate Dimension!"

This was the name of a small-time streamer!

Although he was a small-time broadcaster, his popularity was not low.

Except.

Nowadays, those who enjoyed the benefits of "Fate Dimension" were all very popular. At least, it was much more popular than those games that were broadcasted live in the past. At the very least, it was double the popularity. After all, there were too many games in the past livestreams. There were all sorts of games, and they dispersed the audience and the traffic.

Now.

99.99% of the viewers were live-streaming "Fate Dimension", and 99.99% of the viewers were focused on the "Fate Dimension" panel. There were even some small and medium-sized live-stream platforms that cut all the panels, leaving only "Fate Dimension"!

Xiao Meng.

Xu Meng!

As a fresh graduate who had just graduated from university, she was full of dreams and hope for the future. Unfortunately, as soon as she stepped out of school, the cruel society gave Xu Meng a blow to the head!

College students were not easy to find jobs to begin with, and under the impact of Fate Dimension, the various industries were declining at a visible rate. Finding a job was even harder.

Fortunately.

As a university student of the new era, even if one did not walk at the forefront of the era, at least one's mind was still following closely. Furthermore, there were some young people who liked novelty and were willing to try and play.

This…

He would not have missed the game Fate Dimension, which was an epoch-making game. Since he could not find a job, he decided to go all out and became a broadcaster.

No capital, no backing, no connections!

As a new streamer!

Xu Meng was miserable.

He really started from zero.

Luckily, "Fate Dimension" was not like other games. The livestream was in the game and could be done from the first and third perspective. There was no need for any livestreaming equipment. Otherwise, Xu Meng, who could not afford high-end computers or microphones, would not even be able to do the lowest entry-level livestreaming!

He did not even have the money to buy the most basic live streaming equipment. He had already spent all his savings on the game helmet of Fate Dimension, let alone investing in the game.

So.

The poor Xu Meng had no choice but to become a Buddhist streamer or a lousy streamer!

Under such circumstances.

Salted Fish's live-stream style was born from luck!

If this was in the past, he might have had a way out.

Unfortunately.

There were too many broadcasters like Xu Meng. This earth-shattering live broadcast did not even need the most basic broadcasting equipment. Furthermore, it was so popular all over the world. With such a high number of viewers, it would naturally attract many monsters and snakes to enter the industry. In a situation where there was chaos, wanting to make a name for themselves without advertising was just wishful thinking.

Still.

All of this.

Today, it was completely broken!

Weeping.

This Fate Dimension's most terrifying ID, countless Chinese players, especially the heroes in the hearts of Chinese youths, was naturally Xu Meng's idol!

When she heard that her idol would be broadcasting, Xu Meng naturally went over excitedly!

Perhaps it was the mediocrity of the first half of his life, or perhaps it was even a bit of bad luck, all for today's counterattack.

Xu Meng gritted her teeth and took out a hundred yuan from her tight living expenses. She swiped a hundred application cards for her idol and—

He was lucky to be chosen!

God knew how excited Xu Meng was when she saw the "Teleportation Rune" that Weeping Soul had sent from the backstage!

Xu Meng knew very well.

Perhaps his life had changed at this moment! Fortunately, "Fate Dimension" was not like other games. Live-streaming was in the game and could be done from the first and third perspective. There was no need for live-streaming equipment. Otherwise, Xu Meng, who could not afford high-end computers or microphones, could not even do a live-stream with the lowest threshold!

He did not even have the money to buy the most basic live streaming equipment. He had already spent all his savings on the game helmet of Fate Dimension, let alone investing in the game.

So.

The poor Xu Meng had no choice but to become a Buddhist streamer or a lousy streamer!
