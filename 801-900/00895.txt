Chapter 895: What'S The Difference Between Iron And Bronze?

“That’s it?”

The violent halberd came crashing down with great force. In his rage, Third Lu used his full strength without the slightest restraint. He originally thought that he could easily smash this imp who didn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth in front of him, or even smash him into mincemeat. He never imagined that this brat wouldn’t dodge, but instead directly raised his sword to meet the enemy, actually blocking his incomparably ruthless halberd!

"Courting death!"

Before the astonished Lu San could even begin to doubt his life, a disdainful smile instantly appeared on Qin Sheng's lips. It was as if the two words' just this' were infused into his brain by demonic sounds, causing him to go berserk!

"Your attack has ended. Now, it's my turn!"

Qin Luo Sheng imbued two conventional augmentation skills without leaving a trace. His attack increased exponentially in an instant as he shifted his feet and coolly dodged Lü San's halberd attack. Taking advantage of the momentum, he swung the Sacred Dragon Sword and returned the attack with color.

-328000!

The 300,000 + damage caused the thick HP bar above Third Lu's head to drop by 10%!

"Can't even withstand a single blow!"

Qin Qin Sheng sneered.

Even in his normal form, he was already incomparably berserk, let alone in this state!

A normal Gold Boss was no different from a chicken or dog in front of him!

"Impossible!"

Lü San lowered his head and looked at the sword mark on his bronze skin. His eyes were filled with disbelief.

"This is impossible!"

Ever since he was young, he had been practicing martial arts. Not only did he receive the teachings of his family, he even became a master teacher and received guidance. He thought that even though he could not be compared to the young geniuses of the ancient world, he was at least not far off.

Yet.

The cruel reality gave him a head-on blow!

"Ant, stop talking so much nonsense. If you fall down obediently, you will suffer less!"

Qin Luo Sheng naturally did not know the course of Lu San's soul, nor did he know that this fellow had suffered a huge blow. At this moment, he was doubting his life. However, upon seeing his pained and conflicted expression, compassion instantly flared up. He swung his greatsword at Lu San. "Let me free you!"

Listen! Listen!

Was this human language?

"Destruction of Ten Directions!"

The Unparalleled Halberd Technique was already useless. No matter how powerful Third Lu’s halberd dance was, no matter how airtight it was, against Qin Luo, who was as slippery as a fish, he could not bring out the advantage of the halberd at all. He could not even touch it.

Helpless,

Lü San suddenly thrust his halberd into the ground. Energy erupted from his body, and a violent energy slash shot out from the halberd in all directions!

“Is this the Ten Directions Annihilation? It really is as its name suggests, eight directions, in addition to the heavens above and earth below, there is nowhere to run!”

Qin Qin Sheng was somewhat stunned.

This move.

It was truly beautiful and powerful!

Unfortunately.

Using it from Lv San, that was almost interesting!

He had no choice.

Too weak!

What was the use of having strong skills?

You are the shortcoming. Once you decide, the upper limit will not be too high!

"Sacred Dragon Protection!"

In order to show his respect (Qin Sheng had not capsized in a ditch), Qin Sheng had still used a defensive skill and easily withstood the fatal blow that Lü San had used with all his might!

“Why, why—”

Third Lu was breathing heavily. Holding his halberd, he half-knelt on the ground. As he watched Qin Sheng, who was almost unscathed after his all-out attack and even exceeding 120% strength, convulse all over, his expression stiff!

"You—"

Qin Luo lifted the Sacred Dragon Sword and walked forward step by step. He looked down at the man who was like an iron tower and said expressionlessly, "Too weak!"

"Too weak?"

Lu San smiled bitterly. With a bang, the halberd, which he had always regarded as his life, fell to the ground. His eyes were dark and gloomy. In just an instant, it was as if his spirit and energy had dissipated.

"Let's go!"

Qin Luo Sheng raised the Sacred Dragon Sword and slashed heavily at Lu San.

The expected death with one strike did not happen!

In the end, it was still a simulated battle. Even if the attack was aimed at an absolute weak point, even if Lü San, who had been attacked, had fallen into a weakened state and no longer resisted, his health points were still quite high. In his current state, Qin Sheng's sword could not take his life!

Ding… congratulations on successfully killing Gold Boss—Lv San, EXP gained: 800W, Reputation 500! '

Ordinary Gold Bosses with a higher level had their EXP severely compressed!

Fortunately.

He still had 8 million experience points, which was not bad!

Lü San fell. The group of Lu Village braves who were originally struggling to hold on quickly followed after him!

The flames were extinguished!

The icicle dissipated!

Apart from the mess at the scene, the rest had basically been refreshed. The remnants of the burning flames had all disappeared!

"Let's go!"

After picking up the spoils of war, Qin Sheng took the lead and officially stepped into the Lu Family Village!

"Is it another village-type barrier?"

If it was the Abyss Mode, the huge commotion just now would have woken up the entire village and surrounded them. However, in the Nightmare Mode, the monsters would follow the rules and not move recklessly. They would run out of the areas designated by the system!

“Which one first?”

Mu Mu came up from behind and glanced at the five large areas in front. She asked with interest.

"Whatever. In any case, I have to clear all five regions before I can enter the next stage!"

This scene was extremely similar to Blackwind Stronghold. Qin Sheng had also revealed the method to clear it with a single sentence.

Actually, there was no need to say too much. He understood everything.

Which one of them here wasn't experienced?

Besides.

Even if he couldn't understand it, he could at least understand it, right?

The iconic hundred-meter-tall tower stood at the back of these five areas. Would they be able to pass without clearing the checkpoint?

"Then let's start from the left!"

Qin Luo Sheng could not be bothered to choose either and headed straight for the area on the left!

The style of a village was naturally similar!

Strictly speaking, Lu Village was quite unique. Not only did it retain the ancient Chinese style, but it also had a unique sense of beauty. It was somewhat similar to Miaojiang, but also slightly different!

The monsters in the area were naturally much stronger than those outside. Their name was still Lu Village Yong, but they were strengthened. Their strength had also increased from a black iron Boss to a bronze Boss!

Fortunately.

The monsters had become stronger, but their numbers had also decreased.

In this pavilion, there was a sentry every five steps, a sentry every ten steps, and a sentry every ten steps. The security was extremely tight, and at the same time, it also gave the players some hope. It was no longer like when there were at least ten teams outside. This place was usually guarded by two people, at most four people!

As it was a Nightmare Mode, as long as one did not step into the monsters' territory, it did not matter how loud one's voice was!

Qin Luo Sheng naturally went all out to hit him!

They had wiped out all 40 of Lu Village's Bravehearts along with the Gold Boss Lv San. With a wave of attacks, it was child's play for them to deal with the four strongest people who had strengthened Lu Village's Bravehearts!

Question:

What was the difference between a Dark Iron Boss and a Bronze Boss?

Qin Luo replied:

Nothing!

All the way!

Regardless of whether it was two people in a team or four people in a team, it was like delivering vegetables!

Soon.

Qin Qin Sheng led the four girls to the last area.

A muscular man who was more than three meters tall and had muscles like a dragon looked over with a bloodthirsty look!
