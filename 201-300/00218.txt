Chapter 218: Birth Of A Heaven-Defying Bug Earrings

"Reputation points? Of course it's used up!"

After sending the message, Yatu instantly replied, "Qing Si, Mu Mu, and I each bought a shop. Hehe, Brother Weeping Soul, your Hidden Dragon Pavilion is not the only shop for players now. Be careful not to let us snatch all your business."

Qin Sheng:…

MLGBD!

You bunch of beasts!

I was going to continue shopping, but you beat me to it.

Isn't this way of eating too ugly?

It didn't matter if they ate all the meat. The important thing was that they didn't leave any bones or soup.

Nine people. Nine stores.

‘ I’m afraid they’ve taken all the good seats. Only a few of the inferior ones are left.’

F*ck!

"I was wondering why the Reputation Rankings were filled with crooked melons and jujubes. Turns out those who had the capital had already spent it and bought shops in their main cities."

Qin Qin Sheng finally understood and lost interest in the prestige rankings.

As expected of a toy that was used as a substitute. It was really worthless. It was not even comparable to the money rankings.

The last ranking, Numinous Treasure Ranking:

First place: [Spiritual Water Vein]. Position:???? Grade:???? Owner: Weeping Soul!

The entire ranking list was the same, it was high up and shining brightly.

"Comfortable, comfortable!"

Qin Luo, who was full of vanity, closed the rankings with a satisfied expression.

"Brother Weeping Soul, do you want to do the daily missions of the mercenary group?"

Yatu sent a message.

"No need. I still have a mission to complete."

Qin Qin Sheng replied, "I've retired from the mercenary group. Call me if you need anything in the future."

"Ding… You have already left the Jatu Mercenary Company!"

He switched off the communicator.

Qin Luo opened his backpack and took out his spoils of war. He lined them up and placed them on the floor.

Starlight Miracle, used.

All of them succeeded.

Firstly, Qin Sheng picked up the earring that made him most envious, the Death God's Embrace.

[Death's embrace]

Cooldown: 24 hours!

Introduction: Legend has it that a certain Great Wizard of Darkness gathered eighty-one great dark sorcerers to deal with the invasion of an enemy nation. Together, they used a supermagic spell to summon the Death God. The Death God descended from the netherworld. Endless death energy annihilated millions of soldiers of the enemy nation. However, it also brought disaster to the nation. In order to prevent the destruction of the nation, the Great Wizard of Darkness exhausted its source and used its own soul as a sacrifice to expel death back to the netherworld. It also condensed the death energy brought by the Death God and sealed it in an earring. It is called the embrace of the Death God!

No f*ck to say.

This B was similar to the [Demon's Blood Sacrifice].

The effect was extremely terrifying, but the negative impact was also extremely huge.

However!

The flaws could not hide the jade.

[Death God's Embrace] might not be as explosive as [Demon's Blood Sacrifice], but it was extremely functional.

It was very strong.

Whether it was attributes, effects, or supplementary skills, they were all super abnormal.

However—

Qin Sheng ignored all of these. His gaze was locked onto a line of words in the introduction.

Instakill rate + 5%!

Instant kill rate was the chance to kill in an instant. It could be said to be the most terrifying existence in the world of fate. As long as it was triggered, no matter who it was, they would definitely die in one strike without exception.

Because of this BUG, it was almost impossible to trigger.

Even the Epic earrings with the title of Death only had a 5% chance.

"The heavens are really helping me. I didn't expect the system to drop such a bug-like pair of earrings. I'm really invincible now."

Qin Luo was overjoyed.

Perhaps [Death God's Embrace] was just an extremely powerful earring to others. Even if it was impressive, it was within its range.

However, it was different in his hands, because the Lords of the Stars had one ability—Blessing of the Stars.

This heaven-defying ability could perfectly sublimate any ability on one's body or equipment.

In the past, when he was dealing with the water-type Boss Naga Empress, he had relied on the Starlight Blessing to raise his water resistance to 100%. He was absolutely immune to water-type attacks. That was how he had turned the tables against the wind and obtained victory.

In other words—

If he used the Blessing of Starlight on Instakill, then…

100% instant kill!

Who else?

Qin Sheng put on the [Death's Embrace] without any hesitation and resisted the urge to look for monsters to test it out. He continued to check the spoils of war.

[Shadow Ghost Boots]

Durability: 30 / 30

Introduction: Unknown origins. It used to be the King of Assassins' equipment. Wear it and increase your movement skills. Be flexible. When you move at a high speed, you will be surrounded by ghosts. No one can tell what is real and what is fake.

"As expected of an Epic boots. How terrifying!"

Qin Luo Sheng took in a deep breath of cold air and said in surprise and delight, "Compared to this thing, the Jungle Scamper's Hunting Boots is like a younger brother among younger brothers."

“Too bad the five-piece suit is still missing a handguard.”

Qin Sheng put on the [Shadow Ghost Boots] and looked at the last piece of equipment (a reward from the system after completing the mission). The attributes of a Gold-grade armor were indeed not bad, but with the [Skeleton Heavy Armor], it was useless.
