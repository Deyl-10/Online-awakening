Chapter 221: Mountain Giant

"This trip was worth it."

Qin Sheng, who had already switched on the camera function, was feeling indescribably ethereal at this moment. He had no distractions in his mind and was enjoying the beautiful scenery to his heart's content.

There was a long pause.

Only then did Qin Luo Sheng recover from this state of emptiness.

"Such a beautiful scenery is truly rare in this world. It probably only exists in this virtual world. And the real world that has long been destroyed by humans will no longer exist."

Qin Luo sighed softly and opened the official website of Fate Dimension skillfully. He logged into his own account and looked at the golden account. He smiled and uploaded the video of the scene, naming it "Cliff Ridge". Setting: Free.

"Sharing beauty and nature is what humans should do. They shouldn't be tainted by the smell of copper."

Perhaps he had lost a large sum of money, but Qin Sheng did not care. After completing all the operations, he opened the backstage. "Let me see how much money I earned from the last video."

Ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand…

Qin Luo was dumbfounded.

How… how much was this?

Am I seeing things?

Looking at the balance in the backstage account, Qin Luo shuddered and almost peed his pants.

T-Three million?

"Hiss…"

It was just a video, yet it was so terrifying.

Even though Li Dongliu and the other Legendary BOSSES were indeed impressive, the battle was as if they were watching a battle between gods and immortals. However, this was really too exaggerated. An amateur made a video without much effort and earned more than 30 million?

"This money is too easy to earn. I worked so hard to open a shop and carry bricks. I spent all my effort and energy. I'm as tired as a dead dog. I didn't earn so much."

Qin Qin Sheng ridiculed, "No wonder, whether it was Earth in the previous life or Blue Star in this life, countless people cut their brains and ran to the entertainment industry to join the online live stream. Even if these roads don't move, they still have to take videos and such. This money is f*cking easy to earn."

Qin Luo did not choose to withdraw the money. He left the money backstage and waited for it to be settled automatically at the end of the month. There was a happy smile on his face. "Now, I have the money to buy a house. I can finally register Nannan and let her study in Shanghai."

"It's almost time to go back."

Closing the official website, Qin Luo stretched lazily and took a few deep breaths of the fresh air on the mountain peak. He took out the returning scroll and prepared to leave.

"Move forward, move forward…"

Spatial energy overflowed and the countdown to return to the city was still ongoing. In a few seconds, the teleportation array would be generated and Qin Sheng would be brought away from the peak of this precipice and back to the resurrection point of Star Glory City a hundred miles away. However, at this moment, an ethereal female voice suddenly rang in his ears.

"Who, who is it?"

The teleportation light dissipated, and the return scroll was scrapped in an instant. Qin Sheng shook his head in fear, trying to find the person who had spoken.

"Move forward, move forward…"

He couldn't find her, but the voice continued to reverberate in his ears, as if it was projected directly into his mind. He had no choice but to listen.

"This voice sounds familiar. Why does it sound like I've heard it somewhere before?"

Qin Luo Sheng forced himself to calm down. After pondering for a while with a heart full of worries, he decided to follow the guidance of this familiar voice and walk forward.

"This is?"

The peak of the precipice was only about three to four hundred square meters. It was basically possible to see everything at a glance. Qin Sheng could not think of anything unusual. However, when he followed the direction of the voice to the center, he saw a strange herb with a few vermillion fruits on it.

"Bold vermin, how dare you peek at my divine fruit!"

Qin Luo squatted down, his curiosity driving him to extend his sinful hand towards the fruit. However, before he could even touch it, the ground began to shake violently. At the same time, a vigorous roar filled with rage rang out.

Crash…

Rocks tumbled and rolled as Qin Sheng stared dumbfoundedly. The initially incomparably calm peak of the precipice changed color. The boulders and rocks were controlled by an invisible force and gathered together to form a thirty-meter-tall stone giant.

Qin Luo Sheng: "F*ck!"

Probing skill!

 Yeah. 

Ge. "

How was he going to play this?

I can't play anymore!

Other than his name being filled with question marks, it meant that he was above 10 levels.

Also, Qin Luo had only felt this pressure from Old Feng and Jiu Ying. It was too terrifying and impossible to resist.

If not for the special effects of the Medal of Courage, Qin Sheng would not be standing there, but lying on the ground.

"What kind of sin did I commit? Why did I have to listen to an unfamiliar voice and do this?"

Qin Qin Sheng had a bitter look on his face, wishing he could slap himself twice.

Looking up.

Looking at the mountain giant that blotted out the sky, Qin Sheng felt despair in his heart.

This guy was at least a level 30 Epic BOSS!

He was already invincible. With his size, he didn't even need to use any skills. With just his physical body, he could cause mountains to collapse and the earth to crack. Killing ants like him was as simple as a punch or a kick.

“Those who covet my divine fruit shall die!”

The Mountain Giant did not waste any time and punched down ferociously.

The immense power brought about an aura of destruction. The sound of the fist wind caused Qin Sheng to lose his balance and fall to the ground in an extremely sorry state.

"No, I can't just sit here and wait for death!"

Clenching his fists tightly, Qin Sheng's eyes were filled with fighting spirit. "Even if I die, I can't be hammered to death like a coward. Even if I die, I must die in battle. What's there to fear about a mere rock golem? Perhaps I can't do anything to you right now, but I'll remember this enmity. One day, I'll personally settle this debt."

"Shadow Concealment!"

At the last moment when the violent fist was about to land, Qin Sheng's body flashed and escaped into the shadow of the Mountain Giant. He avoided the damage at the critical moment and saved his life.

Boom…

Qin Luo could escape, but not the ground.

Under the punch, a loud boom was heard, as if a powerful drug was used. A huge crater was formed on the peak of the precipice.

"What level is this BOSS?"

Qin Sheng, who was hiding in the shadow of the Mountain Giant, looked at the mountaintop that was covered in wolves and the bottomless pit that was almost ten meters in diameter. His entire body was drenched in cold sweat. "It actually has the destructive property. One punch almost caused the mountain to collapse. What kind of f*cking monster is this?"
