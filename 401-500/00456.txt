Chapter 456: Sanguine Primrose'S Second Stage Professional Mission

Helpless, he put the [Glazed Taoist Robe] into his backpack and carefully placed it together with the [Duality Dao Sword] that had entered his backpack earlier. Before reaching level 40, he could only eat dust inside!

Following that!

The last treasure he had gotten from Zhang Daoming…

Heart-Protecting Mirror!

[Heart-Protecting Mirror]

Type: Spiritual Treasure

Grade:???

Requirement: None

Durability: 3 / 5

Effect: None

Special Effect: [Protection] When there is a one-time attack that exceeds the damage of the wearer's total health points, the user will forcibly save his health points to 1 point to avoid death!

Introduction: Heartguard Mirror, Lifeguard Mirror.

Good stuff!

A simple introduction. The only effect.

But this did not hinder Qin Luo's high evaluation of the Heart-Protecting Mirror!

These 1,500 crystal coins were well spent!

There were also 3 permanent [Heart-Protecting Mirror], which was equivalent to 500 crystal coins for a life!

Life was priceless, level was priceless, and the equipment on him was priceless!

Qin Luo Sheng could not afford to die now.

The higher the level, the harder it was to level up. If one died once, one level would drop. It would take a week to fill up the gap. Who could withstand that?

Besides.

He only had two pieces of equipment, and the rest were all Epic and Legendary.

If two or three of them died at once, wouldn't they cry to death?

Although he had the additional skill [Life Suppliant], [Life Goddess's Blessing], which gave him a chance to revive every day, after his battle with the Undead Lich, Qin Sheng clearly understood that once one's strength reached the Epic stage, one could not view it with common sense.

In the future, he would definitely meet many stronger and more cunning creatures than the Liches. One more life meant one more chance.

The Heart-Protecting Mirror would become more valuable over time.

If he could persevere until the end of the game, he would definitely be worth much more than the Duality Dao Sword and the Glazed Daoist Robe.

"It's installed! It's installed! Finally, something useful!"

Qin Luo Sheng put on the Heart-Protecting Mirror with a delighted look on his face. He felt a slight chill in his chest and felt at ease. "There's no equipment requirement for this. Furthermore, it's a special equipment that doesn't occupy the equipment slot. It's really awesome! Unfortunately, there's no attribute enhancement. There's no enhancement to one's combat power at all. It's purely a life-saving equipment. If it's like the medal, it can increase one's attributes and also have a unique ability, how great would that be?"

A man without a heart is like a snake trying to swallow an elephant!

Qin Luo Sheng had probably forgotten who it was that was facing the Duality Dao Sword and the [Glazed Daoist Robe] that he was unable to equip. He had put on an expression of pain that was worse than death!

Beep beep beep…

Qin Sheng, who had obtained special equipment, was about to take advantage of the victory to check the remaining spoils of war when someone interrupted him. The urgent and ear-piercing sound of the communicator made him very unhappy.

Open!

【斜体】 "F*ck you!"

Sanguine Primrose again?

What?

I haven't seen you for a day. Do you miss me that much?

How long had it been since he last called?

"Weeping Soul, I received a Class Advancement Mission!—Difficulty Rating, S-level!"

"Help me!"

Qin Sheng:…

F*ck!

Are you a f*cking destined woman?

Why is everything good coming to you?

Isn't this too shameless?

He had just completed an S-rank quest, and now another one was coming?

Was this the European King?

How are we players supposed to survive?

You don't even have a way to accept a B-rank mission. You started off as an A-rank and you can come as you please as an S-rank?

“Sorry, I—”

So what if she was a goddess?

Qin Luo Sheng was not a boot-licker and was about to reject him without hesitation.

Yet.

Before he could finish his sentence, the words that came from Sanguine Primrose made him swallow his words of rejection.

"Mission Revenge, 1,000 crystal coins!"

This…

How can I refuse?

Tsk!

This woman has completely grasped my weakness!

He clearly knew that I was in desperate need of crystal coins, yet he still used this to tempt me!

What should he do?

Accept or give up?

If it were in the past, with such generous remuneration, Qin Sheng would absolutely agree on the spot and nod his head in agreement.

But.

Currently, only he and Sanguine Primrose had reached level 30 and were qualified to be a Second Stage Professional.

With Yatu as a precedent, he was determined to get the Second Stage Profession system reward.

He had originally planned to complete the Second Stage Professional Mission today, but due to his previous battle with the Lich of the Undead, he was still in a weakened state today. Therefore, this idea was put on hold and he planned to do it tomorrow.

Who knew?

At this moment, Sanguine Primrose interrupted his plans.

Accepting Sanguine Primrose's request meant that he would have to hand over the first Rank two player's honor and rewards!

But if you don't accept it, that's 1,000 crystal coins!

According to the drop rate of two to three crystal coins dropped by the Bronze Boss, 1,000 crystal coins was equivalent to 300 to 500 Bronze Bosses.

What should he do?

"I know you also want to be the first to complete the second stage and get the system reward!"

While Qin Luo was engaged in battle, Sanguine Primrose's cold voice rang out in his ears once more, shattering his last bit of hesitation. "I don't care about the system reward. What I want is only reputation, a reputation that belongs to my Sanguine Primrose, a reputation that belongs to the Rose Society. How about this, I'll give you the system reward. Also, 2,000 crystal coins. Think about it!"

The reward is mine?

2000 crystal coins?

Qin Luo Sheng's eyes immediately turned bloodshot!

F*ck!

Was he really going all out?

How can I reject you?

“Deal.”

Qin Luo Sheng immediately replied, "Pay half of the deposit first. The mission starts tomorrow!"
