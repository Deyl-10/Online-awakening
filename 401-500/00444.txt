Chapter 444: The Complete Collection Of Talismans, The Hidden Goods Of The Section

(There's no time, I'll change it immediately)

One, two, three, four, five…

Ten million…

How many crystal coins was this?

It wasn't only Zhang Daoming who was dumbfounded!

Even Sanguine Primrose and Blood Rose were stunned!

One man, two women, and one NPC locked their gazes firmly on Qin Sheng's backpack space that had been "shared". They all fell silent as they watched the other party shine with various colored lights in a corner, illuminating that area in a magnificent manner. It was as beautiful as a rainbow!

Following that!

Her eyes were red and burning!

Zhang Daoming's actions were understandable!

After all, he was a cultivator. He had a great interest in crystal coins, which contained pure energy and was of a higher grade than spirit stones. It was understandable!

But what about the Blood Rose and the Blood Rose?

Very easy to explain!

They were jealous!

Anyone with a clear mind would know that crystal coins were very useful!

These items, such as Augmenting Gems and Spirit Crystals, were basically exclusive to Bosses. When would Bosses drop useless items?

Perhaps!

But that was only equipment!

Even if you want to buy meat, you have to add some to it!

A lean meat with some fat meat!

Very easy to understand!

For example, Gold Bosses dropped Gold equipment, but not all of them. Most of them dropped Silver equipment, or even Bronze equipment. The weaker ones, such as Iron, were considered additions!

It was disgusting!

But it was very realistic!

The kind that you had no choice but to accept!

However!

Crystal coins, Augmenting Gems and Spirit Crystals were special items, or rather, consumables. The former was 100% real, and only Bosses could drop it. The latter two only dropped a lot of Bosses. Other small monsters would drop too, but the drop rate was very low!

Although Qin Luo Sheng did not have any great foresight or strategic vision, he was at least not stupid. He was completely unmoved by those fellows who were purchasing crystal coins, even if they had a huge amount on them!

Look!

All his perseverance was worth it!

If he had sold crystal coins at a low price to those opportunistic merchants, how could he have "seduced" Zhang Daoming?

"Weeping Soul, can you give me some crystal coins? I'll buy it at a high price, the highest price!!!"

Before Zhang Daoming took the bait, Sanguine Primrose took the bait first.

"Sorry! This thing is really not for sale!"

Qin Luo Sheng rejected Sanguine Rose's private message without any hesitation. He was resolute and decisive without the slightest hesitation. "You should also know what crystal coins represent when you and I can open Zhang Daoming's store! You've also seen the power of those talismans. This kind of tool is definitely far beyond what normal players can come into contact with. It has a great strategic use!"

Sanguine Primrose:…

"You and the Blood Rose both have a Message Talisman, right?"

Upon seeing Sanguine Rose's silence, Qin Sheng couldn't help but feel sorry for her. After all, she was the one who had brought him this mission. To be able to meet Zhang Daoming and obtain such a reward, it could be said that he had benefited from her. Even though the crystal coins couldn't be sold to her, it wasn't a problem for him to give her some pointers since she was in a daze.

"In other words, your Rose Society will have two more chances to look for him. I advise you to start purchasing crystal coins in large quantities right now. Right now, no one knows about the use of crystal coins. Those fellows who bought them from the start are only considered investments. In fact, they don't have a bottom line either. They are very afraid that crystal coins are really just useless trash for viewing. All of them will be thrown into their hands. When that time comes, they won't be able to take back a large amount of money and all the goods will be thrown into their hands."

"However, your Rose Society is one of the top ten guilds after all. Every move you make will definitely attract attention. There will definitely be spies from other factions in your guild. How to acquire it without attracting too much attention or without attracting too much attention, you should know better than me. I won't say much."

Sanguine Primrose's eyes lit up!

"Alright! This time, Zhang Daoming's convenience store will belong to you!"

Without the crystal coins, Sanguine Primrose no longer had any competitiveness. She left the stage for Qin Luo Sheng, while she pulled the Blood Rose back a few steps. Together with her, they activated the communicator and started moving.

Without the troublemakers of the two girls, Qin Sheng could finally be at ease and "hoodwink" Zhang Daoming, this "Little Bai"!

"Benefactor, wh-why do you have so many crystal coins?”

Zhang Daoming was stunned for a long time before he finally came to his senses from Qin Sheng's crystal coins that were as high as ten thousand coins. He looked at him with a fanatical expression, his tone somewhat unnatural.

"Ah—You're talking about this!"

Qin Luo Sheng scratched his head "good-naturedly" and said with a smile, "Previously, I accidentally entered a place and encountered some monsters. They were all formed from energy. They did not drop any equipment or items. They did not even leave corpses for me. I could not even gather any materials. All I had were these useless crystal coins. Sigh, I'm really unlucky!"

Zhang Daoming's eyes immediately turned red before turning green. The two colors constantly changed!

Kao!

You're unlucky?

Tsk!

Damn it!

There was actually such a good place in this world?

A monster with pure crystal coins?
