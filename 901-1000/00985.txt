Chapter 985: Brutality, Kill

"True Dragon? How is this possible?"

Elder Snake was dumbfounded.

Looking at Xiaoxiao floating in the air, her entire body was trembling.

"There's no suspense!" Qin Sheng couldn't help but shake his head when he saw this. "He's too restrained! If it were any other Five Poisons, I would still be able to see through him slightly. But this Elder Snake has been greatly suppressed by the might of a tiny True Dragon. I reckon that his strength can only display 50% of his strength, and that's already considered to be the limit!"

"Desert Dust, let's go!"

With the augmentation skill, Qin Luo Sheng did two things at once. He controlled the Weeping Soul Beast and Desert Dust and charged forward together!

As for Xiaoxiao.

They had already started to praise him in various ways!

One after another, spells were thrown down like bright fireworks, and flames rose, causing Old Snake's health points to drop continuously!

"I don't believe it!"

In the end, it was just a half snake. The other half was still human. Even if it was restrained, it wasn't completely restrained. It didn't even have the thought of resisting. Elder Snake roared. After enduring a wave of attacks, he began to counterattack!

"Hunting Tiger!"

Yet.

Things like fighter jets were fleeting. After being stunned for a while, Qin Sheng and Desert Dust had already gotten close. When they saw that the old fellow was going to resist, Qin Sheng roared without hesitation and sent him into a state of fear for five seconds.

A series of explosive attacks!

Facing an Epic BOSS with extremely powerful abilities, Qin Sheng still showed some respect even though he had the upper hand!

Look!

He directly used Holy Dragon Rage!

100% Attack Speed Increased instantaneously!

The effect was simply explosive!

After activating Tyrannical Ambition, Desert Dust turned into a shadow. He couldn't even see it!

It was an attack speed of 1.5 punches per second!

This time.

One second, two punches to three punches!

This was no joke!

The effect of [Tyrannical] was rather terrifying. Every punch of the enemy would reduce 5% of all attributes that did not include Health Points and Mana Points. It could be used for a total of ten punches, which was 50% maximum!

This time.

Under the effects of Hunting Tiger, Elder Snake was crippled!

In less than four seconds, Old Snake's attributes had dropped to 50%!

That was not all.

Qin Luo Sheng controlled Desert Dust and immediately switched his status. [Tyrannical] switched to [Deviant Path]. Using his fists as claws, he attacked Old Snake ferociously!

The effect of [Sly Path] was exactly the same as [Dominance]. However, it did not decrease all attributes, but the upper limit of his health!

This was not a simple injury, but the upper limit of his health!

Once the 50% limit was reached,

So.

Old Snake's health points would be reduced to half when he was at his peak. It was not a loss, but it was only half. No matter what recovery skills he used, he would not be able to recover!

"Poison Swamp!"

Five seconds passed in the blink of an eye!

The effect of [Tyrannical] was maxed out, while [Deviant Path] only triggered five times, even though the attack speed of the claw form was faster than the fist form.

Old Snake recovered, and he immediately sensed his own condition. His expression instantly changed violently, and he couldn’t be bothered about it any longer. He formed seals with his hand before opening his mouth and spitting out a mouthful of ‘thick phlegm.’ When this mouthful of ‘thick phlegm’descended onto the ground, it instantly spread out, and it poisoned the originally hard ground to the point it became green and oily, and it was even slightly soft as if it had become a true swamp!

"Wings of the Flying Rain-Dragon!"

How could Qin Sheng, who had long ago used his Heavenly Eye to probe Qin Luo, be affected? He immediately flapped his wings and flew into the sky.

As long as it did not touch the ground, the so-called swamp was a joke!

Yet.

Qin Luo had wings and could fly. Desert Dust couldn't!

"Jade Bone!"

A skill light flashed, and Desert Dust was instantly enveloped by the light. His defense increased, and he was immune to the highest Epic poison!

Unfortunately.

Elder Snake's poison, this swamp formed from poison, was only an epic poison. It could not do anything to him!

“Allsnake Formation!”

This move was useless, and Old Snake, who was still being attacked by Little Qin and Sheng in the air, was instantly enraged. He immediately activated his skill again without hesitation!

In an instant.

A sinister wind blew!

The originally empty hall, under the special summoning, emitted countless hissing sounds that made one's hair stand on end!

"Ah…"

Qin Luo Sheng had not done anything yet. After all, he had not been in the snake cave more than once or twice. He had experienced it on the real battlefield. That was 100% similar. This little virtual scene was nothing!

Except.

Qin Luo could bear it, but the girls in the team could not!

For a moment.

Screams sounded out one after another!

"Xiaoxiao!"

Qin Luo Sheng looked at Xiaoxiao helplessly.

"Ang…"

Little Tiny, who was telepathically connected with Qin Luo, understood in a split second. It rolled its eyes in a very human manner, and the dragon's roar burst out instantly.

A loud dragon's roar shook the entire Serpent God Hall.

The so-called Snake Dowager, who had been flicking her tongue, was stunned by the dragon's roar before she could even display her might. At the same time, Elder Snake was also dumbfounded.

Dragon Roar Impact was a soundwave skill. It worked on a large area.

How could Old Snake, who was so close, be immune?

The snake array came and went quickly!

Old Snake, who was in a state of shock, was unable to maintain the operation of the array formation. As a result, the Ten Thousand Snake Array vanished!

"Kill this old fellow and summon so many snakes to scare us!"

The group of girls were enraged. One by one, they threw their highly destructive skills at Old Snake, who was still in a state of shock, especially at his ugly triangular eyes and bark face.

"Mutated Snake Transformation!"

All his attributes had dropped by 50%, and his health points were only 50% of his peak. After such a long time of fighting, Old Snake was already on the verge of death. At that moment, he did not hesitate to use his final trump card. His body swelled up, and scales grew on his skin, turning him into a 10-meter-long snake. Its appearance was similar to that of a Blackwater Dark Snake, but although it looked like a small Blackwater Dark Snake, its strength was far superior!

"Has the snake changed?" Upon seeing this, Qin Sheng did not panic in the slightest. He only felt regretful. "What a pity. If the Coiling Dragon Water was still around, the [Ascending Dragon Slaying] that empowers one's abilities would increase one's damage by 1000%. This fellow would probably only be able to GG after three strikes!"

After the Snake Transformation, Old Snake's strength had greatly increased!

Yet.

His grade had become Enhanced Epic. It was true that his attributes had increased, but it was also true that his health points had not changed!

"Kill him!"

Weeping Soul had the penetrative effect of the Sacred Dragon Sword, while Desert Dust had the penetrative effect of the Abyssal Hands' [Sly Path] form. Needless to say, after Snake Transformation, Old Snake was like a snake, suppressed by the True Dragon's might!

No difference!

Even Old Snake, who had transformed into a stronger snake, was no different in Qin Sheng's eyes!

Three Eagle Steps Three Step Up Basket. Desert Dust climbed onto Old Snake's head and began to hammer!

Qin Luo Sheng moved swiftly like a phantom, shuttling back and forth on the ground, causing Elder Snake's attacks to miss completely. At the same time, he was continuously slashed by the golden sword qi that carried sacred flames. He was extremely furious!

Regardless of whether it was physical combat, spitting out poisonous fog, or using magic, Elder Snake had used all his methods, but he still could not withstand this shameless siege. Finally, after enduring for one minute, his health points were completely emptied!

Ding… congratulations on successfully killing level 68 Epic Boss—Five Poison Supremacy [Elder Snake]. EXP gained: 350,000, Reputation Points: 8,000! '
