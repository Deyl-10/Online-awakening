Chapter 958: Hidden Job Scroll: Shadow Assassin

As it turned out.

Qin Luo Sheng knew how to cut, and he was an expert!

Cut?

What was cutting?

Was it better than breaking?

Breaking and cutting was equivalent to being a superior or a subordinate!

‘ Look if you don’t believe me.’

The main purpose of cutting was to cut. If the strength was too weak, it would only leave a mark on the surface. If the strength was moderate, it would be able to cut through skin, flesh, and even bones. If the strength was strong, it would be able to cut into two!

And broken.

He did not play any tricks and directly cut it off!

The weakest effect was the strongest form of cutting!

What else could he say?

So.

Qin Luo Sheng's violent fractures were far stronger than the ordinary cuts required for the test!

Hence.

He passed this round without any surprises or dangers!

The trial continued!

The more profound wind-style mage tactics—

Run!

As the fastest and most penetrative elemental magus, wind-style magi not only used wind-style magic to cut through all things, they also used their speed advantage!

Thus…

A group of monsters appeared and started moving around to attack!

This was a test of the chaotic battle and attacking ability!

"Damn, I'm familiar with this job!"

This test was simply a free point question.

How could the speed of Qin Luo Sheng be compared to the speed of the so-called wind magician? He easily exterminated a group of trial monsters without a single scratch on his body!

Ding… congratulations on passing Feng Mu's trial. Reward: Level + 2, Reputation + 20,000, Hidden Job Scroll * 1! '

Hidden Job Scroll: Stormbringer!

With just a glance, Qin Luo Sheng threw the hidden Class Scroll known as "Stormbringer" into his backpack!

Even though he was now a Berserker, that was right. He was the Berserker from the common warrior branch. In fact, he could also change his occupation to become the Messenger of the Storm. After all, he could coexist with two hidden occupations. He was a Shadow Warrior before, but unfortunately, he was eliminated by the Dragon Abyss Curse. There was no substitute for him. He had always been a Berserker!

Yet.

Qin Luo Sheng looked down on the Stormbringer!

Let alone the fact that the Messenger of the Storm and the Spellblade overlapped, what was so strange about a wind mage's hidden occupation?

Later.

As long as a Spellblade awakened further, they would be able to choose another element. At that time, there would definitely be wind elements, and from there, they would be able to awaken the ability of a wind mage. They wouldn't need this Stormbringer at all!

Besides.

Even without a Spellblade, Qin Sheng would not have changed his occupation to Stormbringer!

What a joke.

There were more suitable choices for him to choose from. Were the Berserker jobs like Berserker and Astral Slash not good? Were the Ghost Shadow and Cold-Blooded Bandits and other hidden jobs not good? There were even the hidden jobs of the mercenary team. Wasn't that good?!!!

If you don't want a BBA, why did you choose a bicycle?

…

Fifth Divine Temple!

It was known as the cold-blooded place of the ghostly shadow!

Cold-blooded, unknown origins, unknown real name.

It was said that he had been an orphan since he could remember.

Coldblood grew up in the slums. He had no family, no friends, and no one to rely on. He could only be reduced to a beggar. However, he was arrogant by nature and did not beg. He lived by rummaging through the leftovers in the trash can, snatching food from wild dogs, being beaten up by local gangsters, being pushed aside by other beggars, and wandering on the edge of life and death countless times.

How could such an experience be normal?

Because Coldblood had been in contact with the darkness all year round, he was good at hiding his tracks, and he had extraordinary talent in this Dao. He actually learned it by himself and found a set of skills!

With an incomplete personality and suffering and humiliation, he relied on his ability to hide in the darkness and disappear without a trace. He killed more than a thousand people who had humiliated him in the past. As a result, he committed a sin and was wanted by the empire. He started a wandering life and was forced to become a killer.

After that.

On a certain mission, he was seriously injured. Just as he was about to die, he was saved by the Mercenary King who happened to pass by. In order to repay the Mercenary King for saving his life, he decided to leave the killer organization.

Following the Queen of Mercenaries, Coldblood transformed from a killer into a mercenary, becoming the sharpest weapon in the hands of the King of Mercenaries. Because he appeared and disappeared unpredictably, killing people without leaving a trace, the targets he targeted, regardless of whether they were men, women, old, or young, could not escape death. It was like an evil spirit demanding for one's life, which was why he was called a "ghost".

"There's nothing to say. I'll definitely be the one to pass this round!"

Qin Luo Sheng accepted the task without hesitation!

Firstly, there were indeed no bandits or assassins in the team, and it was impossible to complete the trial that Coldblood had given!

Secondly, Qin Sheng could not bear to give up. As a trial-taker, it was a reward for obtaining a + 2 level and a hidden vocation scroll. If he could complete it himself, why did he have to fake it for others?

This was unlike an archer who was truly helpless!

As it turned out.

Qin Sheng, who was used to fighting with the shadow warriors, was able to clear the trials set up in cold blood easily!

Less than an hour!

Ding… congratulations on passing the cold-blooded trial. Reward: Level + 2, Reputation + 20,000, Hidden Job Scroll * 1! '

Hidden Job Scroll: Ghost Assassin! (Don't you find it familiar? Sly Shadow Bandit! QAQ)

"Class change?"

Qin Luo Sheng held the hidden occupation scroll and was somewhat hesitant!

Although he liked Berserkers, Spellblades already included a portion of Berserkers. Even if he changed his class to Ghost Shadow Assassin, he could still use Berserkers to fight, and there were also Thieves and Assassins!

"Forget it, I'll watch it later!"

Qin Qin Sheng thought for a while before giving up.

Now.

There was no need to rush!

Where was this?

There were still a few more temples ahead, so there was no need to panic!

…

The Sixth Temple!

Nainai, who was known as a Spiritualist.

Nainai!

This Nainai was not the petite and cute Priest Nainai in the team. She belonged to the Mercenary King's team and was a Summoner!

Its origins were unknown!

It was said that she was abandoned in the Desolate Manku Forest when she was born and raised by a female leopard. From a young age, she observed the behavior of the female leopard and became a leopard girl. With her astonishing talent, she gradually became a "Beast King" in a large area.

After the death of the female leopard, Nainai was no longer restrained. Driven by curiosity, she entered a mysterious cave guarded by the female leopard and ate a spiritual fruit. From there, she mutated, allowing her to freely switch between the human body and the leopard's body. At the same time, she awakened her superpower, which allowed her to connect with the spirit of beasts. She then used her superpower to subdue many powerful beasts.

And then...

The Mercenary King entered the Barren Forest to train and met Nainai.

Nainai, who had been living in the Desolate Manku Forest all this time, saw humans from the outside world for the first time. She was attracted by the colorful world that the King of Mercenaries talked about. After the King of Mercenaries gained experience, she followed him into the world.

Since then.

Nainai joined the mercenary corps of the Mercenary King. She checked her background and toughened herself, gradually becoming stronger!

Finally.

In the face of the invasion of the orc kingdom, Nainai was ordered to summon 100,000 wild beasts from the Desolate Forest and destroy the three main armies of the orc kingdom, preventing the main city of the east from falling. Her name shook the continent, and she was hailed as a "Spiritual Master" by the main gate!
