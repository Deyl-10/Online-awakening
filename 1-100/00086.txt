Chapter 86: Kill? Reverse?

Lunatic!

He was definitely a lunatic!

Apart from 1 Health Point that could not be sacrificed, the remaining 14,720 Health Points were all used to make a deal with the Evil Demons in exchange for equal Attack Power!

It was too crazy!

It was simply unbelievable!

1 HP vs 10000 Attack!??

Did he drift?

"This, this is…"

Elder Feng was completely stunned.

The moment the Demon Blood Sacrifice appeared, the terrifying dark power made him tremble!

So!

After Husky and Vicious Wolf, did they underestimate this brat again?

How was this a vicious wolf? It was a prehistoric tyrannosaur that was countless times more monstrous than a ferocious tiger!

"Little brat, die!"

Elder Feng could not hold it in anymore!

The so-called pride, the demeanor of an expert, was completely abandoned by him.

The members of the evil faction still had integrity?

Previously, he was certain of victory. He would just treat it as watching a monkey perform for fun.

Now, they realized that Monkey had become the Great Sage, Sun. How could this be?

If you don't kill him as soon as possible, do you want to wait for him to react and kill you?

So!

He attacked without hesitation!

What a pity!

He had miscalculated!

His confident attack missed!

"Hehe!"

Even Elder Feng himself did not believe in his own integrity. How could Disheng be so foolish as to believe in his enemies?

He had already been on guard!

The moment the old fellow attacked, he immediately activated his skill.

“Shadow Escape!”

Shadows scattered and shifted instantly.

Swoosh…

Landing, position shifting, body swapping!

"Don't worry, it hasn't even started yet!"

Qin Sheng, who had teleported to the spot where Elder Feng was previously standing, smiled coldly and activated his skill without hesitation, continuing to increase his strength—

"Sirius!"

There were wolf shadows everywhere, and wolf howls shook the sky!

Ding… your attack + 100%, Critical Hit 100%, lasts for 30 seconds! '

Instantly!

His attacks doubled again!

“Come, let me see exactly how capable you are!”

An indescribable power surged wildly from his body. Qin Sheng's expression became extremely excited. Under the dual effects of the Undying Battle Intent and the blood sacrifice of the Evil Demon, he was completely a lunatic at this moment.

"Health Points: 50W +, Attack Power: 1W +, Defense: 4500 +, Speed: 380 +?"

As he counted Elder Feng's attributes, Qin Sheng's bloodshot eyes widened. An extremely violent killing intent accompanied by boundless hostility spilled out. "Heh, nothing more than this!"

"Fight!"

With a roar, Qin Sheng's figure instantly vanished on the spot. With the boost of his high speed, he arrived like a cannonball in the blink of an eye and approached Elder Feng.

The [Coiling Dragon Li Water] in his right hand activated the [Li Water] effect. The edge of the sword was cold and green!

His left hand, [Bloodthirst], activated its ability to suck blood. The blade of the sword was like blood, and a scarlet sword gleam flickered!

The two swords, one cold and one hot, complemented each other, and their sword intent filled the sky!

"Instant Slash!"

With a whoosh, Qin Sheng appeared in front of Elder Feng. The [Coiling Dragon Water] in his hand brought with it an indescribable might as it brazenly landed on the top of Elder Feng's head. The powerful blow seemed as if it was going to cut Elder Feng's head apart.

-1,43492!

The six-figure critical hit hurt so badly that it dazzled Qin Sheng.

"Haha… there's a chance!"

Upon seeing this, Qin Sheng was overjoyed.

Initially, he did not want to give up just like that. Before he died, he wanted to use all his strength. Even if he overestimated himself, he wanted to show off his brilliance and prove that he had once been glorious and had these extremely powerful skills and equipment!

However!

Unexpectedly!

Originally, it was just a final struggle, but he was unexpectedly invincible.

Now!

Other than having only 1 HP and slightly weaker defense, all the other attributes completely surpassed Elder Feng, who was like an insurmountable mountain, this Epic Super Boss.

50W + Health Points?

Haha!

With just one strike, he had wiped out nearly 1500 +, 50W +, just like a candle in the wind!

"Brat, die!"

Elder Feng was shocked and furious after being severely injured in one strike!

He never imagined that he would one day be forced into such a situation by a human brat!

What was wrong with this world?

Could it be that after being sealed for so long and being separated from the outside world for so long, humanity had already grown to such a state?

"Small tricks!"

A disdainful smile appeared at the corner of Qin Sheng's mouth as he watched Elder Feng's ghost claw coming at him at high speed. He moved his body and moved from the front to the back of Elder Feng as if he was shifting positions.

In front of a speed as high as 1235, Elder Feng, who only had a speed of 380, was simply laughable!

"Shadow Stab!"

Another sword hit the back of Elder Feng's head, dealing 107,622 points of damage and successfully stunning him.

"Berserk… Heavy Strike!"

Taking advantage of this opportunity, Qin Sheng gripped the Coiling Dragon Li Water tightly and began to accumulate strength!

One second!

In the blink of an eye!

The moment Old Feng woke up was also the moment when Qin Luo had finished storing his energy!

Boom…

An extremely violent attack landed and heavily smashed onto Elder Feng's right neck!

-35,8730!

A huge damage number floated up. Elder Feng, who wanted to escape, froze on the spot.

"It's over!"

Qin Luo Sheng sneered and withdrew his sword!

143492 + 107622 + 358730!

Chapter 609844!

A total of three strikes!

He had dealt almost 610,000 + damage in total. Old Feng, who only had 50W + Health Points, owed 1100 + damage!

"Is this my peak?"

Qin Luo Sheng was a little obsessed!

Such power was simply too powerful!

Even a BOSS like Elder Feng who had surpassed his limits and reached the Epic level could not withstand a single blow!

"Eh, something's not right!"

Suddenly, Qin Sheng woke up from his intoxication. "It seems that the system did not give any prompts? There was no prompt to kill the Boss, nor was there any prompt to complete the mission!—In that case, Elder Feng is not dead?"

Qin Sheng came back to his senses. However, before he could do anything, he felt a chill down his spine. He froze and could not move.

“Truly an extraordinary little demon. If it was an ordinary person, perhaps they would have been knocked down by your three axes. Unfortunately, the one you encountered was me. Jejejejeje…”

A familiar, strange laughter entered his ears. Qin Luo Sheng lowered his head and saw that Elder Feng, who should have died tragically, was now shrouded in black mist. A green recovery number "+ 10,000" was madly popping up above his head.

He really didn't die!
