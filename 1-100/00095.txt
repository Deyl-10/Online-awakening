Chapter 95: Evil Plan

"Let's go back!"

Shaking his head and shaking off his disappointment, Qin Sheng stood up and prepared to return to the village. "Let's go find that sly old fox, the High Priest, and ask for the reward first. I've sacrificed too much for this damn mission. I've even lost the [Demon Blood Sacrifice] Epic-ranked earring with abnormal functions. If the reward is trash, I'll burn that lousy temple down."

"Beep beep beep beep…"

Just as he was about to leave, his communicator started ringing crazily. The ear-piercing sound spread throughout the entire mine.

“Yatu?”

Qin Sheng could not help but frown when he opened it and saw Qin Luo's ID repeatedly requesting for a call.

He accepted the call!

"F*ck, Brother Weeping Soul, you're finally online!"

After the call connected, Yatu's voice immediately sounded from the other end.

"What's the rush? Even you are cursing!"

Qin Qin Sheng was somewhat surprised.

Although Yatu didn't meet much and didn't have a deep relationship with him, he knew him quite well. Something that could make him lose his composure was definitely not a small matter.

"You don't know?"

Yatu was in disbelief.

“Know what?”

Qin Luo Sheng was even more surprised. Was there anything he needed to know?

"…"

Yatu was speechless. After being shocked for a long time, he slowly said, "You're really generous!"

Qin Luo Sheng: "??”

Yatu hurriedly explained everything!

"Are you saying that the players from other countries were dissatisfied with the two of us appearing on TV, so they blew up Fate Corporation's headquarters and forced the officials to compromise and carry out tests on me?"

Qin Luo felt a headache coming on.

"No, don't drag me into this. I'm just an ordinary person. I didn't cheat!"

Yatu shouted repeatedly, "They're targeting you! Who told you to appear on TV so frequently? You almost wrap everything up by yourself. You eat meat and don't even give soup to others?"

Qin Luo Sheng: "??”

This is my fucking problem?

"You've been on the world television, so your reputation has soared. You've gained countless fans, but there are two sides to the story. With fans, there will naturally be haters."

"It has only been less than a day since the outbreak of this incident, but it has spread like wildfire across the entire world in an instant. To be able to form such a large scale in such a short period of time, there must be a lot of supporters behind it. There might even be the shadow of a big country."

“Now it’s not just your personal problem anymore. It’s escalated to a worldwide problem, a game between countries.”

Qin Luo was silent!

This was truly unexpected!

I'm just playing a game. Is there a need for that?

Even a game between the countries had started!

Scared!

"Why are you always targeting me? I'm just a freaking child!" Qin Sheng felt his heart clench. The joy of completing a mission and retaining his talent was instantly gone.

"Doesn't that mean I'm f*cking done for? I've been reduced to cannon fodder!"

He had just escaped from the system, and now he had jumped into the deep pit between the national games. Wasn't he just out of the wolf's den and back into the tiger's den? Why was his life so bitter!

"Brother Weihun, could it be that you really cheated?" Yatu asked carefully.

"Cheating?" Qin Luo was stunned.

Was he cheating? Even he wasn't sure.

The S-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s

So!

I, Lu… cough cough, Qin Luo did not cheat!

"Do you really think there's a hack?"

Qin Luo retorted.

"Ahem… I was just casually asking!" Yatu choked for a moment and replied, "Of course I believe you, and I believe the mainframe too. Those idiots who lead the way are either really stupid or have ulterior motives. They actually think that the game controlled by the mainframe of Fate has a hack? I'm afraid there's something wrong with their brains!"

"That's right. A clear conscience does not fear a slanted shadow!"

At this moment, Qin Luo Sheng had also calmed down. He said in a relaxed tone, "So what if it's a test? What can you do to me?—If it's any other game, you can still settle the dirty tricks and frame others. At that time, even if it's not shit, it'll still be shit. But this game, hehe!"

"In that case, I'm relieved!"

Yatu let out a sigh of relief. Then, he changed his tone and suddenly became very serious. "Brother Weeping Soul, you must listen to me for what happens next!—Never return to the Beginner's Village!"

"Don't go back to the novice village?" Qin Sheng's heart skipped a beat as he hurriedly asked, "Could it be that there's something important?"

Yatu: "You remember Young Master Thunder?"

Qin Luo Sheng replied, "Of course I do! He's that brat that I mistreated as a dog by the Luo River!"

Yatu: "…Young Master Leiting invested a lot of manpower and resources to stir up trouble. He was basically the one who started the trend in China. He used lies to deceive netizens who didn't know the truth and caused your reputation to be completely ruined."

"Interesting!" Qin Sheng raised his brows and said indifferently, "That's all he's capable of. However, I'm not like those weak-minded fellows. So what if the whole world scolds me? I won't lose a strand of hair! If he thinks he can affect me so easily, he's really a retard."

"It's not that simple!" Yatu's tone became much more serious. "I've received accurate news. That guy spent a lot of effort to bribe tens of thousands of people from Novice Village 6666 and is prepared to make things difficult for you."

"Tens of thousands? He has such ability?" Qin Sheng's pupils constricted abruptly, and he was surprised and bewildered.

"Of course he doesn't have the capability! Let's not talk about other things, just based on the confidentiality of Fate Dimension, even the country can't break it, what is a mere Lei family of Shanghai worth?"

Yatu smiled bitterly. "But he can take advantage of the situation. And this shareholder style is what happened just now."

Qin Luo Sheng seemed to have guessed something, but he did not react. He only sent another message to Yatu. "Continue!"

"That fellow used the jealousy and patriotism of the netizens to slander you wantonly. He described you as a traitor of the current generation, a sinner of the nation. He said that you had disgraced the entire world and shamed China."

At this point, Yatu paused slightly. When he saw that Qin Sheng did not have any special reaction, he continued, "So, he established a post and started another wave of fake reviewers, pushing it to the top of the search rankings."

"Hence, the players in Novice Village 6666 saw it. Those who did not know the truth thought that they had found an organization. They responded to the call and replied that they wanted to participate in the Holy War."

"Under the organization of the poster owner, they came up with a detailed plan to deal with you, the so-called scum, so that you would never be able to walk out of the novice village."

This was really interesting!

When Qin Luo Sheng heard this, there was no fluctuation in his heart at all. He even felt like laughing!

Just this?

How could such a trashy plan appear on stage?

It might be useful to others, but to him?

What a pity!

It was a little lacking!

I've been on the Zuan stage for ten years, and my parents are still alive. How can such a small army scare me?

You bunch of stinky brothers must be dreaming!
