Chapter 47: Epic Belt: Phantom Ribbon

"We're here, come in quickly!"

The novice village was not big. Although Wu Lin's home was remote, it was not far from the center of the village.

Qin Luo Sheng soon brought Lu Dongliang back to the Wu family.

"Kid, I don't remember agreeing to you bringing someone to my house!"

Wu Lin looked unfriendly.

He already had a weird image and his voice was like an owl's. Standing among the piles of alchemy materials that looked like magic, he looked even more horrifying.

As soon as he spoke, not to mention the two girls, Qing Si and Mu Mu, even the two men, Ya Tu and Feng Xing, revealed shocked expressions with cold sweat covering their foreheads.

"They are my teammates. They helped me a lot with the wolf eyes that you wanted!"

Qin Luo smiled apologetically.

Facing this old man with a terrible temper and a strange personality, he really did not dare to put on airs.

Especially now that he had a favor to ask of her, he dared not act rashly!

"I know they're your teammates. Otherwise, do you think they'll be able to enter my Wu family?"

Glancing at Qin Sheng indifferently, Wu Lin said coldly, "Brat, I'll give you face. If you can't satisfy my appetite later, then don't think about my things anymore!"

"I guarantee that Senior will be satisfied!"

Qin Sheng paid no heed to Wu Lin's threat.

Are you kidding me?

Eight million wolf eyes, and you still can't fill your appetite? I'm afraid that when the time comes, you'll be hollowed out instead, and I'll still have more money!

"Oh? Interesting!"

Looking at Qin Luo's confident look, Wu Lin was stunned for a moment before smiling sinisterly. "Tell me, how much do you have? The things are already here, we'll see if you can take them away!"

"This…"

Qin Luo looked troubled. "It's a little too much. I'm afraid you won't be able to eat it, senior!"

"I can't eat?"

Wu Lin snorted unhappily. "Little brat, don't treat me as someone who hasn't seen the world. How many wolf eyes can you take out in such a short time? 100,000? 200,000? Or 500,000?"

"I have a lot of treasures here. The last time I showed you, it was just some rough stuff. If you have enough, I can exchange the real treasures I have!"

Qin Luo was delighted. "Are you serious?"

"Do you think I would lie to a little brat like you?" Wu Lin said disdainfully, "However, real good stuff is very expensive! You're poor, and you don't even have a single gold coin on you. You don't even have a single wolf's eye. Who gave you the courage to boast to me? Your teammate?"

"Heh heh, there's no need for you to worry about that!" Qin Sheng gave a strange laugh and said, "Whatever treasure Senior has, please show it to us juniors!"

"Alright! This might be our last meeting. I'll let you broaden your horizons and make you give up. There are some good things that poor people like you can never afford!"

Poor man?

Qin Luo Sheng's forehead was filled with black lines. He almost could not resist drawing out Bloodthirst and executing this little old man on the spot with one strike!

Five gulps sounded at the same time.

What?

Qin Luo Sheng drooled all over the ground!

Skill Books, and they were all Gold Skill Books!

Wasn't this too strong?

For something like this to appear in a novice village, was it really a blank canvas?

However!

Looking at the price, with the gold as the unit, it was understandable why there was a string of 0s!

Who could afford such a price?

With the drop rate in the Beginner's Village, even if every monster dropped coins, level 10 monsters could only drop 20 to 30 bronze coins. According to the exchange rate of 1 gold coin, it was equivalent to 10,000 bronze coins.

10,000 gold coins?

Haha!

100 million copper coins!

He had to kill 300 + monsters to be able to afford one!

It was practically a death sentence!

"Kid, do you feel like a poor b * stard?"

Looking at the drooling and frenzied juniors, Wu Lin smiled sinisterly.

"Yeah, I'm just a poor b * stard!"

Qin Luo Sheng looked pained.

Especially after seeing the last item on the store list, his heart ached so much that he could hardly breathe.

It was fused into a Spatial Origin Stone and then forged from seven-colored elemental energy.

Afterwards, the wielder was assassinated by the Demon Race, and their whereabouts are unknown.
