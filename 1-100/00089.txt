Chapter 89: Father… Father?

His sinister laughter made Qin Luo's heart turn cold!

"You offended the Little Lord, so I will crush your bones and scatter your ashes. I will shatter your soul!"

Elder Feng had a fanatical look on his face. "However, I've changed my mind now. You're so weak, yet you can unleash such power. You have a demonic artifact on you first, then the power of time. I don't know what other secrets you're hiding. Perhaps you can help me escape this place, or even… revive the young master."

"Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk!" At this point, Elder Feng was so agitated that his entire body was trembling. "I will not kill you. I will very carefully extract your soul and slowly interrogate you."

Qin Luo Sheng suddenly shuddered. He had never felt so bad before!

"This bastard has been pretending to be weak!"

He raised his head and glanced at Elder Feng. This demon who had used his body to block all of his attacks despite his fierce attacks did not seem to be afraid at all. Instead, he seemed to be enjoying the pain. He was instantly terrified!

"He's playing? He's playing! From the beginning to the end, he didn't even look me in the eye?"

Qin Luo was on the verge of a mental breakdown. "Could it really be as he said? Is he immortal? What should I do?"

One sword after another!

One sword after another!

Under the "modesty" that Elder Feng did not counterattack at all, Qin Sheng killed Qin Luo extremely smoothly once again!

However!

The familiar black fog appeared again!

Old Feng, who was shrouded in the black mist, was revived once again under Qin Sheng's piercing gaze!

c

M!

"Kill!"

Qin Luo Sheng's eyes were red as he charged forward like a mad bull, wielding his sword to kill.

"Alright, I've had enough fun. My interest has been worn out by you!"

Elder Feng waved his hand without a care. A powerful force that had never appeared before instantly erupted and bombarded Qin Sheng's chest, sending him flying.

"Now, be good and don't move. I guarantee that I'll be very gentle and you won't feel any pain!"

Is this the end?

Qin Luo, who was flying in mid-air, closed his eyes tragically!

Indeed!

I'm still too weak!

Sorry!

Zhang Xin and many soldiers, I have let you down!

Bang…

Qin Sheng's mouthful of blood rose from his chest and rushed to his mouth like a tap, spraying several meters high!

"Damn brat, get lost. Your dirty hands dare to touch me. I will make you experience countless tortures in the world. You will wish you were dead!"

Elder Feng's manic voice rang in his ears.

"Ha, if you want to skin me alive, why would I listen to you?"

Qin Qin Sheng's consciousness was a little fuzzy, but he did not faint. He turned around, and his back turned into a prone position. Opening his eyes, he looked at the sleeping beauty who was still in a deep sleep. The so-called "little master" that Elder Feng had spoken of was instantly filled with evil intentions as he extended his sinful hand towards her!

“What is this? It’s so strange!”

Qin Qin Sheng's fingertips touched the little girl's sparkling, jade-like face. His heart skipped a beat. "So soft, so bouncy, and warm… Could she be alive?"

“How audacious! You actually dare blaspheme the Little Lord? I’ll burn your bones and scatter your ashes right now!”

At this moment, Elder Feng arrived!

Seeing that Qin Luo's fingers had already touched the little girl, Elder Feng immediately went mad.

Bang!

The strike that came out with hatred ruthlessly struck Qin Sheng's back!

"Pfft…"

Another mouthful of blood spurted out!

As if his spine had been broken, Qin Sheng's body slowly slid down the crystal coffin!

Even though he had three times the defense and three times the HP, he couldn’t withstand two consecutive heavy blows. All that was left was a trace of dead blood. If he was attacked again, he would die even if it was just a touch!

"Are you angry?"

Blood dripped from the corner of his mouth, and his eyes were already blurry. He looked at the furious Elder Feng in front of him and could not help but reveal a smile. "I'm useless if I can't kill you, but to be able to disgust you before I die, I've earned it!"

Ah!

What a pity!

Unfortunately, he did not get what he wanted!

Unfortunately, they were unable to let Zhang Xin and the soldiers rest in peace!

What a pity!

Qin Luo Sheng's eyes were hazy as the light gradually faded away. He, who no longer had any strength, was quietly waiting for death to arrive!

Buzz…

However, at this moment, an indescribable pulse of life rose from behind him!

That was!

The crystal coffin!

"Little… Little Lord!?"

Senior Feng's ghost claw that was raised high did not fall for a long time because his gaze had already shifted from the dead man's Qin Sheng to the little girl who had suddenly "come back to life".

“Why? Why is that? Why did you awaken?”

Elder Feng was so excited that his entire body was trembling, and he spoke incoherently.

For countless years, he had abided by his duties and had always guarded this place, the crystal coffin, and the little master inside. He had never had any disloyalty!

Heaven took pity on her!

His loyalty was finally safe!

Never in his wildest dreams would he have imagined that the little master who had slept for countless years would actually awaken at this moment!

"Greetings, young master!"

Looking at the little girl who floated up like a divine being, Elder Feng fell to his knees and buried his head deep into the ground, crying tears of joy.

"…"

The little girl didn't say anything, nor did she pay any attention to the kneeling Elder Feng. She only extended her little tongue and licked the blood on her face.

This was enough to make any man go crazy for her. It was an extreme charm that could turn the world upside down. Unfortunately, no one appreciated it.

Of the two people here, one was on the verge of death, about to faint, the other prostrated on the ground, extremely sincere, not even daring to raise his head.

The little girl who had swallowed Qin Luo's blood floated down and landed in front of Qin Luo. Her pair of chaotic eyes that seemed to contain the universe gradually regained their clarity.

She looked at him and suddenly understood!

After a long time!

She tilted her head and opened her cherry lips slightly as if she was puzzled. She asked tentatively, "Who are you? Why do I feel an inexplicable sense of familiarity toward you?—Could it be that you are…"

Who?

Who was talking?

Qin Luo, whose consciousness was already fuzzy, seemed to have heard something.

He looked down and saw a pair of snow-white legs!

Even though he was in an extremely weak state, Qin Luo Sheng still felt a sense of lust rising in his heart. Naturally, it was this calf that was hooked up, just this calf!

Unparalleled charm, indescribable!

"…It's really you!"

Squatting down, the little girl reached out her jade-like fingers and gently pushed away Qin Sheng's scattered hair, revealing his covered face. She had confirmed it, and her expression was complicated.

“Uh…”

Qin Qin Sheng could not see who the person in front of him was, nor could he hear what the person in front of him was saying. He tried his best to raise his head to look at her, but in the end, he reached his limit. Before he could complete his actions, he fainted completely.

"Ding! Your mental state has reached its limit. Your brain waves are in danger. The system will kick you offline!"

Qin Sheng wanted to complain, but before he could do anything, his consciousness suddenly dimmed and he fell into silence.

"Who? Who injured you?"

Qin Luo Sheng fainted!

The little girl was completely enraged!

An indescribably terrifying pressure swept out. Under this pressure, the incomparably hard Radiant Ore, which contained the dense power of light, was actually directly shattered, crushed, and turned into powder. The entire mine trembled as if it would collapse at any moment.

"Is that you?"

There was no living thing around him, only—Elder Feng.

The little girl lowered her gaze and looked at the old servant who was kneeling on the ground, wanting her to express her submission. Her eyes were cold.

Elder Feng's body trembled like a sieve, but he did not speak.

He didn't dare!

No!

Due to the suppression of his bloodline, he could not even speak when facing his little master. He could only tremble and lie on the ground like a dog, without any dignity at all.

"You hurt him!"

The little girl glanced at Elder Feng expressionlessly and reached out to the loyal servant who had protected her for countless years. "Then you can die!"

She clenched her delicate hand!

Space collapsed and energy surged!

Elder Feng, who had an undying body and had lived for countless years to wreak havoc in a radius of a hundred miles, was far stronger than an ordinary Ancient BOSS. In that seemingly joking handshake, his body seemed to have been crushed by some force. First, it was crushed, then turned into powder, then disintegrated into the smallest particles, completely disappearing without even ashes!

"I've finally found you!"

After dealing with Elder Feng, the little girl shifted her gaze back to Qin Sheng who no longer had any consciousness. She walked over and carefully leaned her head against his chest. A blush appeared on her beautiful face. She closed her eyes and her long eyelashes continuously trembled. She gently arched her body and let out a satisfied cry.

“Daddy!”
