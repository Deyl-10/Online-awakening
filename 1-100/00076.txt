Chapter 76: Demon-Buster Great General—Zhang Xin!

Even though Lin Yatu believed in Weeping Souls, everything was too unbelievable!

Weeping Soul!

Too powerful!

He was so strong that he did not look like a player!

And not just strong!

Equipment, Skill Books, props…

Which one of them wasn't unbelievable!

Other people's equipment was in tatters and could not even fit together a set. The highest was Black Iron. As for you, the lowest grade was Silver. You even had Epic equipment that could not appear in the Beginner's Village. There was more than one!

Other people only had one or two skills, and it was a basic skill for a beginner class change. As for you, you had a whole bunch of advanced skills. It was as if you had a cheat code. Killing Bosses was like cutting vegetables. The damage was more than a thousand, more than ten thousand. All kinds of instant kill, one sword!

Other people only had potions, and they only had trash shops that could recover 30 points per second. They even wished that one bottle could be used as two bottles to save their HP. As for you, you had a Sky Tremor Bomb in your left hand and a Divine Fire Talisman in your right hand. The potions you took were even instant magnificent potions!

Did the difference have to be so huge?

Why was it that they were all players, and they were just like refugees?

Was she his biological daughter?

Forget it!

After all, many people did not know about it!

But now!

The hidden jobs were here!

And even made it known to everyone!

Did he really think that others did not have a temper?

It would have been fine if it was in the later stages of the game, but you sure are lucky!

But this was still a newbie village!

I didn't even enter your f*cking level three main city and obtained a hidden job at the beginner stage?!

There was nothing to say!

Dogto, cheating dog, official dog son, choose one!

Lin Yatu admitted it!

He was also jealous!

Isn't this too difficult?

Could it be that Weeping Soul Beast was God's illegitimate son? Or did he save the galaxy in his previous life?

Why did she give him all the benefits?

"Contact Weeping Soul, tell him the official actions of Fate!"

Despite his jealousy, Lin Yatu knew what was important. He picked up his communicator and contacted his subordinates.

Regardless of whether Weeping Soul had cheated or not, the benefits it brought him were real. There was not a single bit of fake!

If not for the Weeping Soul Beast, how could he have passed the Nightmare Trial Grounds so easily?

Without Weeping Soul, there would be no dungeon guide, no huge pile of props, no fame of him "walking out of the novice village", and the pavilion would not have such a huge reputation.

All of this was given by Weeping Soul Beast!

He, Lin Yatu, was grateful!

Weeping Souls was a cheater, so he would not kick him when he was down. Instead, he would help him. Not only was it to repay his kindness, but it was also because he knew very well how terrifying Weeping Souls' combat ability and battle awareness were. This was something that he had understood directly after they entered the dungeon and watched Weeping Souls fight.

If Weeping Soul Beast wasn’t a cheater, then it was even more important to win him over. He had to hold on to this thick leg tightly. If he were to give Weeping Soul a message now and send a friendly signal, it would be as easy as lifting a finger. He didn’t need Weeping Soul Beast to thank him. As long as Weeping Soul Beast remembered a little bit of it, he would definitely be able to obtain more from him in the future.

No matter what he did, he would not lose out!

"Boss, we can't contact him!"

Soon, his subordinate's reply came. "Young Master Fengxing and Miss Mu Mu's game time is up. He has gone offline. Miss Qing Si still has some game time left, but she can't contact Weeping Soul. The system says that he is in a special space and cannot contact the outside world."

"Really? I understand!"

Lin Yatu was silent for a while before he hung up and sighed, "I should say that you are indeed worthy of your reputation, Weeping Soul. To be able to remain calm and ignore such a big event, you must be an extraordinary person with such a big heart. I really want to meet you in real life and see just who you are!”

…

The game world!

Dark Forest!

On the second floor of the mine, at the end of the tunnel!

Qin Luo Sheng squinted his eyes as he sized up the imposing man who stood towering at the entrance of the third level. He was wearing a feathered helmet, a chainmail that was like a mountain, and a sword that stood upright like a statue.

[Demon-Buster Great General—Zhang Xin (Enhanced Gold Boss)]

Level: Level 10

Health Points: 100,000

Attack: 2350

Defense: 850

Speed: 255

Skills:???

Introduction: The Demon-Buster Army belongs to the Imperial Court's military and is a special type of soldier. The Great General, Zhang Xin, is from a military family. He followed his father to the battlefield when he was ten years old and joined the Demon-Buster Army. He has been in the army for more than thirty years and has made many outstanding military achievements. He was conferred the title of Great General and commanded 500,000 soldiers. A few years ago, the Spiritual Light Mine appeared and he was ordered to guard it. In the end, his whereabouts were unknown.

"Hiss…"

Qin Luo Sheng gasped!

Health Points of 10W +, Attack Power of 2350, Defense of 850, Speed of 255?

Was this a Gold grade boss?

This was a level 10 BOSS?

It was probably not the Naga Empress that he had met before. The Bronze-Armored Zombie was a counterfeit product!

"It's also a level 10 Gold Boss. This letter has an additional 'Enhancement'. Its attributes have doubled compared to the Naga Queen?"

A

 Yeah. 

g.”

Qin Luo Sheng felt completely unwell!

Only now did he fully acknowledge the Naga Race's actions from the bottom of his heart!

Indeed!

With Empress Naga's naive (retarded) thoughts, she still wanted to lead the Naga Race to attack the humans? She really didn't know what to say. Other than bringing the Naga Race to destruction, there was absolutely no other way.

A single Zhang Xin, a general of the human race, could crush her, the empress!

The two races were worlds apart!

It could be imagined that once the Naga Race really did something, a random army would be able to wipe out the entire Naga Race.

"If a gatekeeper has such strength, then what about the sinister devil behind the scenes!?"

Qin Luo's heart hit rock bottom!

It was not that he wanted to be negative, but the system really did not treat him as a human!

Look! Look!

This Demon-Buster Great General—Zhang Xin, was this a Boss that humans could defeat?

Not to mention one person, even if there were a hundred five-man teams, they would only be delivering food!

Even if he was a hacker, he could not withstand the official hack!

How could a small passer-by with no backseat compare to a wall and a lock?

They were on completely different levels!

"Looks like I'll have to use up the trump card I prepared for the sinister devils here!"

Qin Luo Sheng silently opened his skill column, equipment column, and backpack one by one. He combed through everything he had before closing his eyes and rehearsing his tactics in his mind.

Dealing with a pawn could be done in a carefree manner, and he could even use it as a tempering stone to temper his combat techniques and temper his skills. However, if he still did this when facing a Grand General, then he was courting death!

Current game time: 1 hour in the morning!

Current Real Time: 21: 17!

Remaining game time: 9 minutes 32 seconds!

"Is there only 10 minutes left?"

Qin Luo frowned slightly.

It seemed like it was impossible to complete the mission today!

Fortunately!

It was already past nine at night and it was less than three hours until the next day!

In other words, once 0 o'clock passed, the game time would be reset and there would be another 10 hours of game time!

The mission duration was one day, 24 hours!

It had been six hours since the High Priest had accepted the mission!

There was still plenty of time!

"The mission time problem is solved, but there is still only one chance!"

Qin Luo Sheng raised his head and looked at Zhang Xin, who was still like a statue. He took a deep breath and assumed a battle stance. "If that's the case, then so be it! Before killing that sinister devil, let me meet the former Demon-Buster Great General first!"
